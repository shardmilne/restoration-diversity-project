It is sometimes confused with S . wallacei (see discussion), and it shares some characteristics with the Mexican species, S . extensa L. Underwood. In S . oregana , very often where a branch fork occurs, one of the branches is arrested (R. M. Tryon 1955). The strobili of S . oregana are among the longest in the flora, and they often show several novel features. Very often the apex of a strobilus undergoes a period of vegetative growth, thus becoming a vegetative shoot, and after an interval the apex reverts to the fertile condition, forming a strobilus again. In other cases, the strobilus forks, giving rise to two new strobili."

Zika	Vascular Plants: Ferns and Lycophytes	Cystopteridaceae	31543	Gymnocarpium dryopteris		species		Y	N	N	N	N	N	N	Native		{"Herbarium":"WTU"}	FNA2: "Gymnocarpium dryopteris is a fertile allotetraploid species that arose following hybridization between G . appalachianum and G . disjunctum (see reticulogram). Its wide distribution over much of the north temperate zone has provided ample opportunity for secondary contact between G . dryopteris and each of its diploid parents, thereby resulting in a wide-ranging composite of abortive-spored triploid crosses ( G . disjunctum × G . dryopteris and G . appalachianum × G . dryopteris ). These relationships are shown on the diagram. Sterile triploid plants are not restricted only to areas where the range of the tetraploid overlaps with that of either diploid. Their broad distribution could be explained in part by their spores, which are of two types: malformed, black, and with very exaggerated perispores, or round with extensive netted perispores (K. M. Pryer and D. M. Britton 1983). The latter spore type is capable of germination and presumably permits the plants to reproduce apogamously. The name G . × brittonianum (Sarvela) Pryer & Haufler has been applied to the G . disjunctum × G . dryopteris hybrid formula (K. M. Pryer and C. H. Haufler 1993). The type of G . × brittonianum has aborted and round spores, and leaves that strongly resemble those of G . disjunctum . They are large, 3-pinnate-pinnatifid, and the second and third pairs of pinnae are sessile with basal basiscopic pinnules markedly longer than the basal acroscopic pinnules. Sterile triploid plants with a morphology similar to the type of G . × brittonianum are frequent. The biology of both of these cryptic hybrid taxa needs further study, which should lead to detailed morphologic descriptions and distribution maps.<br><br>Gymnocarpium dryopteris also hybridizes with both G . jessoense subsp. parvulum and G . robertianum ."

Morphologic and ecological data indicate P . imbricans is ancestor to the northern forms and P . munitum is ancestor to southern forms, suggesting P . californicum is an amalgam of interfertile tetraploids with polyphyletic origins (D. H. Wagner 1979). Cytological analysis corroborates this (A. D. Callan 1972; W. H. Wagner Jr. 1973), but chloroplast DNA studies have detected only the involvement of P . imbricans in the ancestry of P . californicum (P. S.

Hybrids with both P . dudleyi and P . munitum are found frequently, because these three species are often sympatric (W. H. Wagner 1973). The hybrid with P . dudleyi (a triploid) will key to that species. The hybrid with P . munitum resembles a less-incised form of P . californicum with aborted sporangia. Polystichum californicum × imbricans has been found only once, in Oregon (A. D. Callan 1972). Another hybrid that will key here, based on its overall appearance, is P . munitum × scopulinum . It lacks filiform microscales and also has malformed sporangia. Such a specimen was the basis of the report of Polystichum californicum in eastern Washington (C. L. Hitchcock et al. 1955--1969, vol. 1). The sterile diploid hybrid between P . dudleyi and P . munitum is indistinguishable from P . californicum except for aborted sporangia and chromosome number (W.

Four widespread, named hybrids are treated in the key and fully described below.<br><br>In species descriptions and in the key, length and width are given for the leaf sheath, excluding the free teeth. If the length and width of flattened sheaths are approximately equal and the sides are straight, the sheath is more or less square in face view, i.e., about as long as broad; if the length is greater than the width and the sides are straight, the sheath is more or less elongate in face view, i.e., longer than broad; if the length is greater than the width and the sides are slightly convex, the sheath is elliptic in face view.

Variations in spore surface morphology and banding patterns observed in isozyme studies indicate that P . hesperium may have originated more than once from different individuals of the same species. Some collections of P . hesperium can be mistaken for P . glycyrrhiza , but the latter species is easily distinguished by its pubescent rachises, linear blade scales, and smaller spores (less than 58 Âµm). Although P . amorphum has sporangiasters and P . hesperium lacks them, misshapen sporangia in P . hesperium can mimic these distinctive soral structures. Therefore, it is often necessary to use a combination of soral, stem scale, and blade scale features (discussed in the key) to separate P . hesperium from P . amorphum . Hybridization occurs between P . hesperium and each of its progenitor diploids to form triploid individuals with misshapen spores (F. A. Lang 1971).

The taxa comprising the Pteridaceae in this treatment were assigned to the Sinopteridaceae and Pteridaceae by D. B. Lellinger (1985) and were included in five families by R. E. G. Pichi-Sermolli (1977). The broad concept followed here is similar (except for the exclusion of Ceratopteris ) to that espoused by R. M. Tryon and A. F. Tryon (1982), who applied the name Pteridaceae to the group. Until very recently, the newer name Adiantaceae was more commonly used.<br><br>As represented in North America, Pteridaceae comprise three major evolutionary lines (the adiantoids, the pteroids, and the cheilanthoids). Characteristics holding the family together include abaxial (usually submarginal) sori that lack indusia or are protected by a reflexed or revolute leaf margin, spores that are usually globose-tetrahedral and trilete, and chromosome base numbers of 30 or 29 (rarely 27). The xeric-adapted members of the family (particularly the cheilanthoids) have undergone extensive parallel and convergent evolution, and they have frustrated attempts to produce a natural generic classification based on macromorphologic characteristics alone. Although some workers have aggregated species into a few large genera (e.g., J. T. Mickel 1979b), most tend to recognize smaller segregate genera based on a combination of morphologic, chromosomal, and biochemical data. The latter approach seems to provide a more useful, evolutionarily informative classification and is the one adopted here. Aspidotis and Notholaena are maintained here as distinct from Cheilanthes , and three recently described genera ( Argyrochosma , Astrolepis , and Pentagramma ) have been incorporated into the treatment. The reasons for these changes in generic circumscription are discussed under the individual genera."

Because the plants fix nitrogen, they are often used as a green fertilizer or mixed with livestock feed as a nutritional supplement. Azolla pinnata has been cultivated for many centuries in rice paddies of northern Vietnam and southeastern China, where it acts as a fertilizer after it decomposes.<br><br>Azolla is the most frequently studied genus of ferns in the world because of its economic importance. The three North American species are naturalized in Europe and South Africa, and they have been introduced into Hawaii for horticulture and into Asia for agriculture. All species have been studied for agricultural uses in rice-producing areas.<br><br>Azolla is usually found in stagnant or slow-moving water of ponds, lakes, marshes, swamps, and streams. Plants turn reddish when under stress, such as from poor nutrition, salinity, or high temperatures. Sporulation needs further investigation."

Garman 1957; K.W. Horton 1959; L.Roche 1969; T.M.C. Taylor 1959). This has greatly complicated the taxonomy of P . glauca , a dominant tree of interior forests of Canada and Alaska. Three varieties have been recognized. Picea glauca var. albertiana was described as having unusually prominent leaf bases, cones nearly as broad as long, cone scales acute and broader than long, and an unusually narrow crown. These are common characteristics of hybrids (e.g., R.Daubenmire 1974). Picea glauca var. porsildii was described as differing from the type variety by having smooth bark with resin blisters, short angular cone scales, an unusually broad crown, and pubescent twigs. These characteristics, also largely intermediate between those of P . glauca var. glauca and P . engelmannii , may reflect hybridization where the species overlap. Although the two varieties noted above are reported from well beyond the range of sympatry, the diagnostic characteristics are not well correlated and occur rather sporadically. Also the most distinctive feature of the varieties, the crown shape, is in part responsive to competitive pressures. Because of the problems of hybridization and sporadic occurrence of key characters, P . glauca is treated here in the broad sense."

In size and shape of leaves and flowers the two taxa are very similar. They differ in the leaf mottling often present in developing leaves of N . tetragona but absent in N . leibergii ; the distinctly tetragonal appearance of the receptacle in N . tetragona ; and in the longer carpellary appendages, the presence usually of more stamens, and purple-colored stamens and pistils in N . tetragona . Only in living plants is it apparent that leaves of N . leibergii are thicker with impressed veins abaxially compared to the relatively thin leaves with raised veins in N . tetragona .

Taxonomy and nomenclature follow FNA, departing from the treatment in H&C, where plants called Atriplex dioica (Nutt.) J. F. Macbr. (from Montana) are now considered A. suckleyi (Torr.) Rydb. (Bassett et al. 1979). The name Atriplex dioica (Nutt.) J. F. Macbr. was published in 1918; the name Atriplex dioica Raf. was published in 1817.<br><br>FNA4: "The distribution of the species is evidently bipartite, with an eastern coastal series extending northward mainly from New Jersey to Newfoundland and along the St. Lawrence seaway, and perhaps extending to James Bay of Hudson Bay. The western grouping lies mainly west of the 95th meridian of longitude, where it has been collected since early historical times to the present in saline marshes or other saline sites from the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories, southward to southern California, northern Arizona, northern New Mexico, and Oklahoma.<br><br>Rafinesque gave the following information: "Stem upright angular branched, leaves petiolate, deltoid, acute, thick, scaly, the proximal opposite toothed, the distal alternate, hastated, entire: flowers dioical glomerate, male spiked naked, female unequal, sepals deltoid, warty-crested."<br><br>The name Atriplex dioica Rafinesque antedates Chenopodium subspicatum Nuttall by half a year, being published in December 1817. Hence, it is the correct name for the widely ranging species, which has passed most recently under the name A. subspicata. Nuttall's description of the habitat of Chenopodium subspicatum is: "In saline soils around Mandan Village, Missouri," a designation of habitat that applies to this day.<br><br>The species forms a mirror-image set of specimens with the remarkably similar Atriplex prostrata, from which it may be distinguished in most cases by the thickened, merely ovate to lanceolate leaf blades, and less commonly but in some localities exclusively triangular-hastate to lanceolate, mostly scurfy and prominently 3-veined leaf blades. In some specimens, including the types of both Chenopodium subspicatum and Atriplex carnosa, the blades bear a hastate lobe at or above the base and sometimes match triangular-hastate profile of A. prostrata. The leaves of A. prostrata are typically thin-textured, green, not scurfy, and the veins of the blade are obscure. I. J. Bassett et al. (1983) disallowed within A. dioica (as A. subspicata) any but those with lanceolate blades, including those with the proximalmost leaves with a pair of subbasal hastate lobes. However, there are numerous specimens in which the blades are thickened and transitional in that regard to the triangular-hastate profile as in A. prostrata. Certainly those specimens with triangular or triangular-hastate leaves taken prior to the introduction of A. prostrata sometime late in the nineteenth or early twentieth century, clearly belong to the indigenous A. dioica. Whether there are intermediates between diploid (2n = 18) A. prostrata and tetraploid or hexaploid (2n = 36, 54) A. dioica is not known. There does not seem to be any consistent feature or combination of features by which all specimens can be assigned to one or the other of the two taxa. It seems probable, however, that A. prostrata is a late introduction from Europe, and that it, along with the related A. heterosperma, is now invading habitats previously occupied exclusively by the indigenous A. dioica."

It is a loosely arranged aggregate of still insufficiently understood races. Hundreds of segregate microspecies and infraspecific entities (including nomenclatural combinations) of the C. album aggregate have been described and/or recognized by various authors. Some authors have recognized numerous segregate intergrading species, while others have developed elaborate infraspecific hierarchies with numerous subspecies, varieties, forms, and even numerous subforms (e.g., B. Jüttersonke and K. Arlt 1989), or have combined both approaches. Neither approach has brought satisfactory and uncontroversial results.<br><br>It is evident that most recent evolutionary processes within the group were greatly affected by anthropic factors, including extensive recent invasions, hybridization between previously geographically isolated taxa, poly-ploidy, intensive selective processes and mutagenesis in synanthropic habitats, gene drift, and so forth. All of these modern factors further complicated the taxonomic situation. Consequently, no infraspecific taxa are formally recognized in the present treatment. We attempt, however, to outline below the most common or noteworthy groups currently placed in Chenopodium album sensu lato. Although we list such groups under binomials, they should be considered here as informal groupings rather than accepted species.<br><br>It should be also kept in mind that many enigmatic and deviant forms of the Chenopodium album aggregate are in fact hybrids with other (occasionally several) species, and between infraspecific entities. C. album hybridizes with C. suecicum (producing C. ×fursajevii Aellen & Iljin), C. opulifolium (producing C. ×preissmannii Murr), C. strictum [producing C. ×pseudostriatum (Zschacke) Murr], C. ficifolium (producing C. ×jedlickae Dvorák or C. ×zahnii Murr), C. berlandieri (producing C. ×variabile Aellen), and some other species."

These plants are very variable, and usually have broader leaves and more lax inflorescences, which might be a result of hybridization with other species of the C. album aggregate. The native status of such forms is very questionable. Typical C. strictum also occurs in North America, but seems to be less common. Some narrow species and hybrids of the C. strictum aggregate are recognized in Eurasia (P. Aellen 1928; F. Dvo ák 1989; P. Uotila 1977, 1993, 1997). Some of these taxa, especially C. striatiforme Murr and C. novopokrovskyanum (Aellen) Uotila, are superficially similar to the native North American taxa of subsect. Leptophylla. Eurasian forms of the C. strictum group usually can be distinguished by their venation pattern (in most cases more than three visible veins even in narrowest leaves).

Putative hybrids with C. villosum reported in FNA.<br><br>FNA4: "Corispermum pacificum seems to be closely related to Siberian C. crassifolium Turczaninov and C. maynense Ignatov. The latter species occurs in the northeastern Russian Far East and may be expected to occur in Alaska. Corispermum pacificum differs from C. maynense by its usually more robust habit, and its wing rounded (rarely rounded-truncate or indistinctly emarginate, but not triangular) at apex. From C. crassifolium it may be distinguished by the constant presence of perianth segments, and more flattened black mature fruits. Corispermum pacificum probably also occurs in adjacent regions of British Columbia. Corispermum pacificum is placed in subsect. Crassifolia (S. L. Mosyakin 1997). This subsection seems to be of Siberian origin, with its central species, C. crassifolium, being closest to the hypothetic ancestral taxon. The presence of perianth segments in C. pacificum may be explained by ancient hybridization with representatives of subsect. Pallasiana.<br><br>Reproductive isolation between the sympatric species of Corispermum may be achieved by different flowering periods. Occasional hybrids between C. pacificum and C. villosum are similar in their habit to C. pacificum in having usually broad leaves and rather dense inflorescences but they have mostly aborted fruits suggesting that C. pacificum and C. villosum are taxonomically distant species."

This is the common native annual species in coastal marshes. FNA suggests S. virginica may be the best name for this plant, if the Atlantic and Pacific populations are the same taxon. As with all our Corispermum taxa, for many decades this plant was mistakenly given the binomial and introduced status of a European species.<br><br>FNA4: "Salicornia depressa is the common and widespread species in coastal areas of North America. No detailed taxonomic investigation of the tetraploid populations has ever been undertaken in North America. It is possible that a number of different taxa exist; the Pacific Coast populations in particular seem distinct from those of the Atlantic Coast.<br><br>This species has generally been called Salicornia europaea by North American authors, but that name refers to a diploid European species that does not occur in North America.<br><br>The earliest name that is probably referable to this species is Salicornia virginica Linnaeus, which must be typified by specimens collected by John Clayton probably from Virginia. The specimens are sterile but clearly annual, as indicated by Linnaeus in the protologue. The name was applied to an annual species by P. C.

Although it is possible to identify dry specimens to some extent, by comparison, it is impossible to obtain from dried specimens data that can be used in a taxonomic revision. Characters that may be taxonomically useful are lost on drying, especially flower and inflorescence characters and those derived from the fleshy vegetative segments. Habit appears to be useful, but few specimen labels note the habit of the living plant, and the parts collected rarely allow for a reliable determination of habit. Some species, such as S. perennis are prostrate, with the woody stems readily rooting in the substrate. Others such as S. pacifica are procumbent to erect shrubs in which the woody stems usually do not root. This apparently obvious habit difference is sometimes confounded by external factors, erect species becoming procumbent due to water movement, trampling, or burial by silt or sand deposits. Conversely, prostrate rooting species can be disturbed by erosion and appear to be procumbent plants of a nonrooting species.<br><br>One of the most useful characters, the indumentum on the testa of the seeds, is rarely present in dried specimens because of the lateness of the plants' flowering season. Plants collected in August and September rarely have even immature seeds present, so most herbarium specimens do not display this character.<br><br>The consequence of these problems is that most accounts of Sarcocornia in North America recognize only one species, frequently using the name Salicornia virginica Linnaeus for the collective entity. The type specimens of S. virginica were collected by John Clayton, presumably from Virginia, which are immature annuals and not flowering. The name S. virginica cannot be applied to a species in this genus."

Mosyakin has been collected in Multnomah Co., Oregon, and may be found in Washington.  Recent molecular work may change the nomenclature again (Ryan & Ayers 2000).<br><br>FNA4: "Salsola tragus probably was introduced to South Dakota in 1870 or 1874 in flaxseed imported from Russia (J. C. Beatley 1973c; C. W. Crompton and I. J. Bassett 1985; S. L. Mosyakin 1996). Now this noxious weed occupies almost all of its potential range in North America. It seems, however, to be quite rare in the southeastern part of the United States.<br><br>Salsola tragus has been known in North American and European botanical literature under numerous names (for detailed synonymy see S. L. Mosyakin 1996 and S. Rilke 1999). Judging from the photographs of the Linnaean specimen of S. tragus (LINN 315.3), which should be regarded as a lectotype, it is the correct name for the widespread, narrow-leaved, weedy representative of the S. kali aggregate (Á. Degen 1936-1938, vol. 2; N. N. Tzvelev 1993; S. L. Mosyakin 1996; S. Rilke 1999).<br><br>In the present circumscription, Salsola tragus is an extremely polymorphic species consisting of several more or less distinct races (subspecies or segregate species). Several varieties may be recognized within S. tragus, many of them are just morphological variants of little or no taxonomic value.<br><br>Studies using allozymes and DNA-based molecular markers in some North American and Eurasian representatives of Salsola tragus indicate that there are at least two cryptic genetically divergent populations (F. J. Ryan and D. R. Ayres 2000). More studies may clarify distribution, origin, and taxonomic status of these infraspecific taxa (or cryptic species).<br><br>In spite of being a noxious weed, Salsola tragus is an additional forage source for livestock in arid rangelands. The mature plant may break off at the stem base to form a tumbleweed."

In the northeastern part of its range, S. calceoliformis was long known as S. americana, but the two were found to be conspecific (I. J. Bassett and C. W. Crompton 1978). Suaeda calceoliformis can easily be confused with S. occidentalis, with which it is sympatric in the Great Basin; see comments under S. occidentalis. Plants of the annual Mexican seepweed, S. mexicana (Standley) Standley also are similar to S. calceoliformis, but are more or less shiny, yellowish or light brown, and have opposite leaves at the base and alternate ones distally.

The type specimen was collected in 1820 by Edwin James along the Canadian River in the Texas panhandle. J. Torrey (1827) tentatively identified it as "Chenopodium maritimum L. ?". Rafinesque named it Chenopodium nigrum, long before Torrey's publication of the name Chenopodina moquinii in 1856. C. O. Hopkins and W. H. Blackwell (1977) suggested that the name Chenopodium nigrum was both a nomen nudum and a superfluous name. But the publication of that name included a clear reference to Torrey's 1832 publication, which means that the name was not a nomen nudum, and the specimen belonged to a new species, which means that the name was not superfluous. "Suaeda fruticosa" with the incorrect author combination (Linnaeus) Forsskål has been misapplied to this species (H. J. Schenk and W. R. Ferren Jr. 2001).<br><br>Suaeda nigra exhibits much phenotypic plasticity, as well as genetic variability, and is wide ranging. This combination has resulted in the naming of many variants that often reflect a response to localized or regional habitat conditions such as degree of wetness, salinity, or freezing temperatures (C. O. Hopkins and W. H. Blackwell 1977). In California and adjacent states, for example, glabrous plants (S. torreyana var. torreyana) and pubescent plants (S. torreyana var. ramosissima) occur throughout the distribution of the species. In California it is coastal but not estuarine in the San Francisco Bay area and in Orange and San Diego counties. Plants of northern latitudes or higher elevations that are prone to freezing tend to have annual stems from a woody base. Plants that occur in more southern or milder conditions are usually shrubs with perennial stems. Plants in seasonally flooded wetlands tend to be facultative annuals.<br><br>In the western and northern part of the range, most plants of Suaeda nigra are glabrous or sparsely pubescent and more or less long leaved."

There are virtually no differences in floral characters. Bracts of S. occidentalis often appear thin-margined at the base in dried specimens but not in fresh material, whereas bracts of S. calceoliformis have visible membranous margins in both. Differences in bract and branching characteristics are usually distinct in fresh specimens. Larger specimens of S. occidentalis are usually branched throughout, with the spreading branches resulting in a more-or-less spherical shape of the plant. The mostly ascending branches of the more-erect S. calceoliformis tend to be concentrated in the upper half of the main stems, with primary branches sometimes arising from the base, and therefore creating a candelabrum shape of the plant."

The first specimen of A. alpina deposited at WTU was collected in 2007.<br><br>FNA19:<br><br>"Excluded names:<br><br>Some Antennaria names are based on early-generation interspecific hybrids, including:<br><br>A. ×rousseaui A. E. Porsild = ? A. alpina × A. rosea<br><br>Antennaria alpina is one of the more morphologically variable agamic complexes in the genus. Some taxonomists have argued that true Antennaria alpina does not occur in North America, because none of the North American material exactly matches the type of A. alpina, which is from Lapland (M. O. Malte 1934; A. E. Porsild 1965). If one uses a strict typological species concept, then this is true; I recognize that this species complex is composed of innumerable apomictic clones and am circumscribing a broad species concept for A. alpina. The potential morphologic overlap between the A. media and A. alpina complexes is a major taxonomic problem. The chief difference between members of the two complexes is the presence of prominent flags on cauline leaves in A. alpina and their absence in A. media. Antennaria alpina of North America is gynoecious and characterized by its dark green to black phyllaries and conspicuous flags on the distal cauline leaves. The basal leaves vary from glabrous, as in the type material, to pubescent.

Some of the introduced taxa in Washington belonging to this family are not included in the FNA volumes.  Many of these can be found in Stace's New Flora of the British Isles (1997).  Ken Chambers and Scott Sundberg provided a treatment of the Asteraceae for the Oregon Flora Project (OFP), and some of their taxonomic decisions are followed here rather than what is provided in FNA.

Balsamorhiza have been synonymized under B. hookeri. Nevertheless, a number of taxa are justifiably segregated as species by their morphologic differences and geographic restrictions. One might logically choose either of two taxonomies: recognizing only two species in the entire genus, one representing subg. Artorhiza and the other subg. Balsamorhiza, or recognizing each slightly differing population as a species. Either course results in an unsatisfactory classification. The present classification is a compromise. A knotty problem persists. A central cluster of populations from eastern Washington to southeastern California display a number of minor and locally discrete morphologies. They tend to be less isolated from each other than are the peripheral populations, although some tend to mimic the latter ones in one or more characteristics. Their evolutionary history may be involved with past hybridizations with each other or with species of subg. Artorhiza, gene drift, and polyploidy. At present, it appears impossible to reach a satisfactory classification."

Intermediates with var. odontolepis are known through much of that range."<br><br><br>"Cirsium remotifolium occurs from the Coast Ranges and valleys of the Pacific Northwest to the western slopes of the Cascade and Klamath ranges, south in the California North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay region. It is closely related to the C. clavatum complex of the Rocky Mountains region. Both have a similar growth habit and some forms variably express the character of broadly scarious, lacerate-toothed phyllary margins. Gray, in naming Cnicus carlinoides var. americanus, included as syntypes both California and Colorado specimens. F. Petrak (1917) treated both the West Coast plants and those of the Rocky Mountains as Cirsium subsect. Americana, recognizing C. remotifolium with several infraspecific taxa plus two other species, C. callilepis and C. amblylepis from the West Coast, and four additional species from the Rocky Mountains. A. Cronquist (1955) rejected Petrak's subspecies, treating C. remotifolium in a restricted sense, limited to plants of Washington and Oregon without dilated phyllary tips, and circumscribed C. centaureae broadly to include the Rocky Mountains and West Coast plants with dilated phyllary tips. Because of the frequent presence of dilated phyllary tips in C. remotifolium in the restricted sense, Cronquist acknowledged the likelihood of past introgression with C. centaureae in the broad sense.<br><br>J. T. Howell (1960b) recognized three species: Cirsium remotifolium, C. acanthodontum, and C. callilepis, the latter with four varieties collectively corresponding to the West Coast representatives of C. centaureae (in the sense of Cronquist). Because of the great similarity of the various West Coast plants and their intergradation, I see no value in recognizing two or more species.<br><br>The West Coast and Rocky Mountains plants are clearly related, but are separated by the Great Basin region and there is little chance of current genetic interchange. As is often the case with American Cirsium, genetic enrichment from past hybridization with other nearby species within their respective areas has likely been fertile ground for evolutionary diversification. Different species have contributed genes in the Pacific states and in the Rockies. I have chosen to recognize two geographically-based species complexes, each with intergrading races here treated as varieties. I treat the West Coast plants as C. remotifolium and the Rocky Mountains plants as C. clavatum."

Plants at lower elevations tend to produce tall stems branching above the middle and long, white rays. At higher elevations, especially in Idaho, western Montana, Utah, and Wyoming, stems tend to be shorter and simple and the rays commonly are blue to violet. In the Bitterroot Mountains (Ravalli and Deerlodge counties, Montana), short-stemmed, blue-rayed plants also have strigose cauline vestiture (in contrast to typically deflexed-hirtellous stems); these vestiture variants occur in the same area with plants apparently similar in all other features. Strigose populational variants also occur in Saskatchewan and Yukon, and E. abajoensis, largely distinguished by strigose cauline vestiture, might be considered a regional variant of E. caespitosus. In eastern Idaho and southwestern Montana, plants of E. caespitosus are commonly encountered with cauline leaves obovate and distinctly subclasping. Plants with strongly 3-nerved basal leaves occur in Carbon and Gallatin counties, Montana.

The leaf bases are usually narrowly to broadly cuneate or attenuate (rarely rounded). Distal leaf faces usually have about 10–50 hairs/mm  2  and about 4–20 glands/mm 2 . The variety is the most variable in the species and includes some local distinctive morphotypes that grade into other forms. Plants intermediate between this and all other varieties occur in areas where the ranges are sympatric, and they make infraspecific taxonomy of the species difficult. The variety has been incorrectly referred to as var. hispida (a later synonym) in most floras.<br><br>The status of Heterotheca barbata (Rydberg) Semple (Chrysopsis barbata Rydberg), the Spokane goldenaster, is uncertain. J. C. Semple (1996) treated it as a separate species to draw attention to the problem; a detailed description based on the type and detailed illustrations were included. It is known from the type collection along the Spokane River Valley east of Spokane, Idaho, and two down-river, atypical collections (Benton and Spokane counties, Washington). It flowers in July (sometimes August). It is similar to H. villosa var. minor, but differs in having lanceolate-elliptic distal cauline leaves (34–38 × 8–9 mm) that are little reduced distally, long branches (each with one to a few large heads), and disc corollas with a few, very long hairs on the tube. Further work is needed to increase the number of specimens available for a detailed comparison with H. villosa var. minor in order to clarify whether H. barbata warrants species level recognition, should be included in H. villosa as a variety, or placed in synonymy under var. minor."

The two forms have been recognized as weakly defined species (or varieties), the former as Senecio foetidus and the latter as S. hydrophiloides. They intergrade so completely that they are best treated as a single, variable taxon.

Cronquist 1994).<br><br>In 1900, Thomas Howell gave the name Senecio oreganus to a collection from Lake Labish, near Salem, Oregon. The area has seen much disturbance and development since Howell's time, and the plant appears to be extinct in the region. The collection is difficult to exclude from S. hydrophiloides, and the collection is here regarded as an odd outlier of S. hydrophiloides, which is known chiefly from east of the Cascade uplift. Howell's collection and therefore the name S. oreganus also have been treated within S. sphaerocephalus (T. M. Barkley 1978; A. Cronquist 1955); that attribution appears to be in error.

Therefore, the appropriate name under Tripleuro-spermum is T. inodorum. She also considered its type to belong in T. maritimum and formally recognized it there as subsp. inodorum, on the basis of hybridization with other T. maritimum subspecies (A. Vaarama 1953); on the same basis, however, Hämet-Ahti maintained the species distinction between T. inodorum and T. maritimum, while making T. phaeocephalum  a subspecies of the latter. Q. O. N. Kay (1994), in a more extensive review of the literature and of hybridization data, also maintained T. inodorum and T. maritimum as distinct species, a conclusion followed here. From the standpoint of weed science, taxonomic merging of T. inodorum and T. maritimum  has the inconvenience of grouping under a single specific name taxa that have different physiologies, ecologies, weed potentials, and, possibly, reactions to weed control measures.<br><br>The name Matricaria inodora var. agrestis Weiss was not validly published."

As discussed under A. pycnocarpa, A. hirsuta does not occur in North America, and the characters separating all three species (see key to species), as well as the different ploidy levels, support Mulligan's conclusion.<br><br>Both M. Hopkins (1937) and R. C. Rollins (1941, 1993) recognized the glabrous or subglabrate forms native to North America as a distinct variety, var. glabrata; G. A. Mulligan (1996) did not accord such forms any taxonomic status.

An examination of the type collections of both species reveals that they are distinct. Although the fruits and seeds of A. olympica are not fully mature, they are clearly different in width and orientation from those of A. furcata  at the same developmental stage. The striking differences in fruit width and orientation, stem indument, and seed and flower size support their maintenance as distinct species. Although both species grow in Washington, the range of A. olympica seems to be restricted to Clallam and Jefferson counties and is disjunct from Chelan, Kittitas, and Yakima counties, where A. furcata grows."

Based on available data, both taxa occupy the same habitats in North America, but the Asian taxon is much more widespread. The occurrence of European C. flexuosa was, until now, confirmed only for Washington, where both taxa have been recorded. More detailed studies of the North American distributions of both these weeds are needed."

These characteristics do not appear to be strongly correlated. A case in point is the holotype sheet of var. semitonsa, which includes plants with puberulent or glabrous fruits, as well as with pubescent and glabrous stems that are 0-4-leaved. Leafless and densely pubescent scapes are found in Trelease 3913 (MO), whereas completely glabrous, 0-2-leaved stems, and fully appressed fruits are found in Calder 5617a (DAO).

Indeed, a casual observation would immediately justify the recognition of var. thompsonii. Both fruit types can be found in plants of the same population (e.g., the RSA isotype) or even on the same plant (e.g., Thompson 10816, MO). Furthermore, fruits to 2.5 mm wide occur sporadically in various parts of the species range.

The variation almost always does not correlate with geography, and the recognition of varieties in this species is neither practical nor very useful. All of those authors admitted that these varieties are "very weak at best" (Rollins, p. 554). Of them, perhaps var. pubicarpum (including var. elongatum) might merit recognition. It is distributed in almost all of the Mountain and Pacific states and is distinguished from the other varieties solely by the presence of trichomes or minute papillae on the fruit valves. The density of these trichomes ranges from moderate and covering the entire valve surface to very sparse and represented by individual papillate trichomes restricted to the valve margin. Furthermore, the length of these trichomes may vary from ca. 0.01 to 0.3 mm. In some species (e.g., L. dictyotum) both glabrous- and pubescent-fruited forms occur, yet none of the above authors gave formal recognition to both forms.

In some collections (e.g., Scoggan 4233, GH; Boivin et al., 13221, GH), both puberulent- and glabrous-fruited forms occur. It is almost certain that the same situation exists not only in other populations of this species, but in other North American Lepidium.

If one examines only the types of those two taxa and that of P. fremontii, it seems that perhaps two or three taxa might be recognized. Upon careful study of extensive material, one realizes that only one taxon, instead of three or more, is represented. The alleged differences between P. fremontii and P. williamsiae in characters other than fruit morphology do not hold. As for fruit size, it was said to be 2-4 × 2-2.5 mm in P. williamsiae and (4-)6-13(-20) × 1-2 mm in P. fremontii. Fruit lengths in material annotated by Rollins as P. fremontii are 2-7 mm in Tiehm 8108 and 3.5-11 mm in Ertter 5726, both at GH. Furthermore, the compactness of the infructescence can be equally variable, and in the holotype of var. confertum there are 12-15 pedicels along 1 cm in the middle of the rachis, whereas in Ertter 5726 (GH) there are 6-12. On one sheet, Schoolcraft 1287 (GH), compact and lax racemes and relatively short (3 mm) and longer (7 mm) fruits are represented. The variation in fruit length and width depends largely upon the number of ovules maturing into seeds, and in plants with very short fruits, including the type collection of P. williamsiae, none of the ovules matured into seeds, whereas in those with longest and narrowest fruits almost all ovules matured into seeds. Regardless of how long the fruit is or how many ovules mature into seeds, the ovule number is fairly constant throughout the range of the species. In my opinion, except for the type species of Polyctenium, all of the other taxa recognized in this genus do not represent biologically distinct entities.<br><br><br>To my knowledge, Polyctenium fremontii is known from counties in California (Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Siskiyou), Idaho (Gooding), Nevada (Churchill, Douglas, Humboldt, Lyon, Mineral, Washoe), and Oregon (Crook, Deschutes, Harney, Klamath, Lake, Malheur)."

It is generally considered a native of Eurasia and is thought to have been introduced into the New World by European settlers about 400 years ago. Recent archaeological and ethnobotanical studies (H.

Zika	Vascular Plants: Dicots	Brassicaceae	60699	Thysanocarpus curvipes		species		Y	N	N	N	N	N	N	Native		{"Herbarium":"WTU"}	FNA7: "Thysanocarpus curvipes is the most widespread and variable species in the genus. Variants have been named as varieties or species, but they grade into each other imperceptibly. Notable among these are var. elegans, a form with incised or perforate fruit wings, and var. eradiatus, a form with rayless, entire wings. Some of these may be the result of hybridization with other taxa. For instance, var. elegans  has large fruits and occurs in the vicinity of T. radians, the largest-fruited member of the genus. Furthermore, fruits of var. elegans  often have pointed hairs like those usually found on fruits of T. radians; such hairs are not found on fruits of any other members of the genus. Thysanocarpus curvipes includes both diploid and tetraploid populations (M. D. Windham, unpubl.), but these do not appear to segregate into recognizable groups. Although the variation in T. curvipes is considerable, its great complexity prevents recognition of infraspecific taxa at this time."

Indument characters have often been relied upon in the circumscription of taxa.  However, the presence and morphology of trichomes varies within all four varieties of S. rotundifolius, and the geographic distributions of indument types are complicated and overlapping.  Corolla morphology offers more reliable features.  Intermediate specimens not classifiable to variety, even in flower, do exist.  A few specimens have been identified, based on morphological intermediacy, as possible hybrids between S. rotundifolius varieties and other sympatric species, including S. albus, S. longifolius, and S. mollis.<br><br>Variety vaccinioides is very often labeled Symphoricarpos oreophilus var. utahensis in herbaria and in floristic literature; however, the type of the latter name is referable to S. rotundifolius var. oreophilus."

Cerastium beeringianum's pubescence consists of straight, strigose, multicellular, somewhat fuscous hairs of several lengths, many of those in the mid and distal stem and inflorescence being glandular and viscid. The nodes and the leaves, at least in the mid and distal stem, typically have long, strigose, eglandular, fuscous hairs; those on the adaxial surface of the leaf being appressed, and those on the nodes retrorse. However, plants from the many small, isolated populations on the mountains of western North America show a great deal of variation. Some of these populations tend to be subglabrous, lacking most of the long hairs normally found on this species. Others are small, delicate plants with slender divaricate pedicels and smaller capsules and seeds. Though names have been given to several of these variants, they frequently intergrade, and much of the variation is greatly influenced by the environment."

Cerastium brachypetalum differs from all those species in the long, silvery hairs that give it a grayish appearance. In Europe C. brachypetalum is more variable and eight subspecies have been recognized, two of which—subsp. brachypetalum and subsp. tauricum—occur in North America. However, they differ only in the absence or presence of glandular hairs, an insufficient distinction for recognition at the subspecific level."

Kruckeberg, and reported by J. K. Morton in his treatment of Silene for Flora of North America. Closely related to Silene oregana and S. sargentii. Not in H&C - see JPM for a key to species.<br><br>FNA5: "Silene bernardina is the earliest valid name for this species. Watson had previously (1875) named it S. montana, and that name was taken up by C. L. Hitchcock and B. Maguire (1947), who cited S. bernardina as a subspecies of S. montana. Unfortunately, the epithet montana is pre-occupied in Silene by S. montana Arrondeau (1863), an unrelated European species. The situation was further complicated by Watson in 1877, when he used the name Lychnis montana for another unrelated species now transferred to Silene and called S. hitchguirei.<br><br>Silene bernardina varies in leaf width, pubescence, and flower color. The broader-leaved and more sparsely pubescent forms have been referred to subsp. bernardina, and the more-common, narrower-leaved, more-densely pubescent, and viscid forms have been referred to subsp. maguirei.<br><br>Some forms of Silene bernardina can be difficult to distinguish from S. verecunda, S. sargentii, and S. oregana. Silene verecunda differs in its smaller, clavate calyx and in its petals being only shortly two-lobed. Silene sargentii is a small, densely cespitose, high-alpine species with very narrow, linear leaves (1-2 mm wide), shortly two-lobed petals, and seeds with much larger papillae around the margins. In S. oregana the petals are larger (two times the calyx) and deeply divided into many very narrow segments; the claw and the filaments are glabrous; the leaves, particularly the basal ones, are broader; and the inflorescences are narrower, with the more numerous flowers arranged on short, ascending branches; also, the calyx lobes are ovate and obtuse instead of lanceolate and acute."

Recent molecular studies indicate that Calystegia is nested within Convolvulus (Stefanovic, Krueger, and Olmstead, 2002).

It grows mostly inland and sometimes to 3000 meters, but from the specimens that they annotated, the ranges are not distinct. N. L. Britton and J. N. Rose (1905) and W. L. Jepson (1923-1925) have separated it, at least varietally, under other names, but most authors have included it without comment or at most have called it doubtfully distinct. I call it merely a phase of C. aquatica not needing a formal name (R. V. Moran 1992b). A typical strand plant is depicted in the lower left corner of the illustration panel on this page."

Some authors have included them all in R. rosea [or Sedum rosea (Linnaeus) Scopoli], often with subspecies or varieties; N. L. Britton and J. N. Rose (1905) earlier divided them into two to several species.<br><br>For this complex C. H. Uhl (1952) cited six published chromosome counts from Greenland through Eurasia to Japan, all n = 11 or 2n = 22; he found the same numbers in seven collections from northeastern North America (all these Rhodiola rosea proper). From Eurasia, according to R. L. Taylor and G. A. Mulligan (1968), races with 2n = 16 and 33 also are known. On the other hand, for endemics in Minnesota and New York and for five plants from New Mexico and California, Uhl found n = 18 or 2n = 36, and Taylor and Mulligan likewise found 2n = 36 in plants of Moresby Island, British Columbia. With the support of five more counts, but with none for the large area of Oregon and Wyoming to the Bering Sea, R. T. Clausen (1975) separated the 36-chromosome plants as Sedum integrifolium. More counts of 2n = 36 have since appeared, including one from Sutwick Island, off the Alaska Peninsula (Á. Löve 1979).<br><br>In middle North America, Rhodiola integrifolia and R. rosea are geographically distinct. The local endemic subsp. leedyi of the former grows in Minnesota, midway between the western subspecies of R. integrifolia and the eastern R. rosea, and grows in New York state within 100 km of R. rosea. Otherwise, the ranges of the two species are over 2000 km apart in the south and nearly 3000 km in the north. Rhodiola integrifolia also is the prevailing plant in eastern Asia, where it has been named Sedum atropurpureum N. S. Turczaninow (E. Hultén 1941-1950, vol. 5), and R. rosea seems to extend (although not verified by chromosome counts) from eastern Asia to far-western Alaska, on the coast of the Bering Sea.<br><br>Although saying that Sedum integrifolium differs from S. rosea in many ways besides the chromosome number, R. T. Clausen (1975) found few absolute distinctions. His best key characters were those used here, petal width of staminate flowers, largely supported by flower color. Although questions remain unanswered, it seems best for now to follow Clausen in keeping the two species for North America.<br><br>Over its broad range, Rhodiola integrifolia is quite variable (e.g., see E. Hultén 1941-1950, vol. 5). R. T. Clausen (1975) noted that in some populations pistillate plants outnumber staminate; in others staminate may be six times as many as pistillate. He distinguished two outlying endemics as subspp. leedyi and neomexicana, also kept as subspecies here. He also proposed subsp. procer[a] for tall robust plants of Colorado, New Mexico, and (less typical) California, all within the range of subsp. integrifolia and all with the same chromosome number. Some of his plants look remarkably different from the usual dwarf forms of subsp. integrifolia that grow at the same high elevations. He did not include in subsp. procera (and apparently did not see alive) the tall plants often found inland in Alaska and northwestern Canada, which would be Sedum frigidum Rydberg according to Hultén. Thus the racial situation is much more complex than the naming of only two peripheral subspecies might suggest."

The general morphological differences are: in S. rupicolum leaves of sterile shoots are ovate and detach easily, sepals have obtuse apices, petals have minutely mucronate tips (0.1 mm), and nectaries are deep yellow; in S. lanceolatum leaves of sterile shoots are linear-lanceolate and do not detach easily, sepals have acute apices, petal apices are long-acuminate (0.8 mm), and nectaries are pale yellow."

In the central to northern Sierra Nevada, mixed with the widespread form are individuals that are eglandular and have a cover of relatively short, whitish hairs on the stems and inflorescences. Similarly, throughout most of its range, A. patula is nonsprouting after fire, and in areas characterized by winter snow cover it layers and creates broad, low mounds. In much of California, it typically sprouts after fires from obscure and flattened burls, forming circles of erect sprouts."

This is the most widely distributed of all Arctostaphylos species and is the only one found outside of North America. Two ploidy levels are common, and populations sometimes contain both diploids and tetraploids. More work on this widespread species will likely elucidate its variation in morphology and ploidy.

All specimens of Cassiope lycopodioides that I have seen have curled hairs on the leaf apices of at least the young leaves. The hairs appear to be fugacious. However, subsp. cristapilosa does differ from subsp. lycopodioides in several features. It lacks the hyaline leaf margin as well as the adaxial surface and abaxial leaf base pubescence.

Blake (1917), in discussing the complex, stated, "...while the differential characters brought forward for their specific separation are confined to differences in size, in the prominence of the venation, the shape of the sepals, the direction of the pedicels, and the rotundity of the stem, characters which are not only rather obscure but at best are merely comparative, and are shown by the material examined to be by no means absolutely constant." Hiroshi Takahashi (1987), who did not consider subsp. domingensis, found broad overlap in most morphologic characters used to distinguish the subspecies. Extreme forms of the spectrum of morphologic expression may be distinctive; variation among the taxa appears to be clinal. Only subsp. domingensis, which is geographically isolated on Hispaniola and has glabrous peduncles and pedicels, glabrous filaments, and relatively small leaves, appears to be sufficiently distinct from the rest of the species to warrant recognition (L.

Some phylogenies show Cyrillaceae as sister to Ericaceae; other analyses have Clethraceae and Cyrillaceae as closest relatives to each other, together forming the sister group to Ericaceae. Monotropa and related genera (genera 5-12 of this treatment), and Pyrola and related genera (genera 1-4 of this treatment) have been treated as families Monotropaceae and Pyrolaceae. Not all botanists agreed with this, as summarized by G. H. M. Lawrence (1951): "Many botanists (including Hutchinson) have held the view that the Pyrolaceae are not sufficiently distinct from the Ericaceae to be treated as a separate family." Differences in habit, floral features, and pollen have helped maintain family status for Pyrolaceae and Monotropaceae in regional floras. Molecular and morphological analyses (K. A. Kron et al. 2002) show these lineages embedded within Ericaceae. Similarly, Empetraceae has been demonstrated to be nested within Ericaceae and is here included in the Ericaceae.<br><br>Studies in the last several decades, especially since 1990 including molecular data, have resulted in rearrangements of generic limits in the Ericaceae. These are discussed under the various genera; for the reader's convenience they are summarized here. Ledum is included in Rhododendron; Leiophyllum and Loiseleuria are included in Kalmia; and Hypopitys is included in Monotropa. Arctous is separated from the much larger Arctostaphylos, to which it is inferred to form a sister clade. Eubotrys is segregated from Leucothoe, with which it has often been combined. Vaccinium is treated in a broad sense, to include segregates such as Oxycoccus; although Vaccinium is decidedly polymorphic, this seems a workable approach until generic limits in the Vaccinieae Reichenbach are better understood."

V. Coville 1903). It is a major host of pinyon blister rust in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, and of pinyon leaf rust in New Mexico (E. P. Van Arsdel and B. W. Geils 2004). Ribes aureum is a variable complex and the varieties may seem to intergrade. In California, var. aureum occurs in sagebrush scrub or coniferous forests at higher elevations (800-2600 m) than var. gracillimum; the sepals of var. aureum are longer than those of var. gracillimum (5-8 mm versus 3-4 mm), and its hypanthium is noticeably shorter relative to the sepals. Leaves of var. aureum are more highly lobed and are sparsely glandular in the Pacific Northwest and less lobed and more densely glandular in the southwest (H. D. Hammond, pers. comm.). In most of its range, var. villosum is so conspicuously villous as to be unmistakable; in the west some plants with strikingly long hypanthia are scarcely villous."

Variety hudsonianum has a more northern distribution; var. petiolare is western. Where their ranges overlap, for instance in Saskatoon, pubescence density varies continuously and does not correlate with presence or absence of glands (V. L. Harms, pers. comm.).<br><br>Ribes hudsonianum is a major host of blister rust; in early literature it is referred to as R. petiolare (E. P. Van Arsdel and B. W. Geils 2004).

C. L. Hitchcock (1957) accepted five varieties within the typical subspecies; morphological intergrades exist. A case can be made for recognition of var. calva C. L. Hitchcock, which has been listed as endangered both federally and in Washington, where it is endemic. These plants are generally robust, sparsely appressed-hairy with four-rayed hairs, the leaves are generally nearly glabrous and fleshy-textured, and the calyx lobes are subglabrous and ciliate. Found in the Wenatchee Mountains, an area of high endemism, var. calva does not appear to be much different from other, nearly glabrous populations elsewhere; it appears to be the only variety with a chromosome count of 2n = 60. This treatment does not accept both subspecies and varieties within Sidalcea; therefore, it has been placed here into synonymy with the wide-ranging, variable typical subspecies. Subspecies oregana can generally be distinguished from the other subspecies by its more-open inflorescences that are elongated in fruit, its multistemmed clumps as much as 30 cm in diameter, its generally stellate-hairy to glabrescent stem bases, its generally uniformly stellate-hairy calyces, its somewhat reticulate-roughened mericarps, and its bracts that are generally equal to or shorter than the young flower buds. Subspecies oregana appears to be the source of commonly sold cultivars. It has been listed as sensitive in Montana and as rare in British Columbia."

L. Fernald 1950; H. A. Gleason and A. Cronquist 1991). If so, the species apparently spread very rapidly, because herbarium specimens exist from Ohio in 1828, Michigan in 1837, and Maine in 1837. J. Chapman et al. (1974) presented archaeological evidence of pre-Columbian presence of M. verticillata at a site in Tennessee.<br><br>Morphology and anatomy of the species are well studied. T. Holm (1911) investigated anisophyly in Mollugo verticillata and stated that the leaves are not "pseudo-verticillate," as described by some earlier authors, but are truly opposite. M. A. Payne (1933, 1935) conducted morphologic and anatomic analyses of the leaf, stem, root, flower, and seed of the species. Pollen morphology was examined by N. Mitroiu (1971).<br><br>Several subspecific taxa have been described for Mollugo verticillata, but these are poorly understood; attempts to subdivide the species in North America for this treatment failed. The species is extremely morphologically variable, especially with regard to leaf shape, overall size, and habit. There seem to be no direct correlations between habitat type and morphology.<br><br>Mollugo verticillata possesses intermediate C3-C4 photosynthetic pathway characteristics, such as well- defined bundle-sheaths with numerous C4-like chloroplasts, distinct palisade and spongy parenchyma as in C3 plants, and intermediate light to dark ratios of CO2 evolution, which have made the species of particular interest in studies of the evolution and biochemistry of both photosynthetic pathways (R. A. Kennedy et al. 1980)."

The genus Oenothera as circumscribed in H&C has been split to distinguish Camissonia, comprised mostly of annuals here in Washington.  Species level changes are extensive in the genus Epilobium.  Much of the taxonomic revision in Onagraceae is reflected in the first and second editions of the Jepson Manual, so that is the primary floristic reference used here.

Formal recognition of varieties is even less tenable when Eurasian elements also are considered.<br><br>Aquatic-adapted plants, which bloom in water or are sometimes stranded on land, have been called var. stipulacea (although that epithet may not be the oldest one available for the taxon). They produce ovoid-conic to short-cylindric inflorescences 10-40(-60) mm, prostrate aerial stems, and leaf blades that are glabrous with acute to rounded apices. Terrestrial forms of this ecotype usually are spreading-pubescent and often bear ocreae that are foliaceous, green, and flared distally, characters found only in North American plants (R. S. Mitchell 1968).<br><br>Terrestrial-adapted plants, referred to var. emersa, bloom on moist soil and produce short- to elongate-cylindric inflorescences 40-110(-150) mm, spreading or erect aerial stems, and leaf blades that are appressed-pubescent with acute to acuminate apices. They produce ocreae that are entirely chartaceous and not flared distally. Emergent and terrestrial plants of this ecotype exhibit less phenotypic plasticity and a lower frequency of heterostyly than do plants of the aquatic ecotype (R. S. Mitchell 1968).<br><br>R. S. Mitchell and J. K. Dean (1978) and H. R. Hinds (2000) recognized var. amphibia, the Eurasian element, as introduced in New York and New Brunswick, respectively. These plants are morphologically intermediate between the North American ecotypes and often indistinguishable from North American plants (Mitchell and Dean)."

Extremes are evidently distinct (e.g., R. arcticus and R. tomentellus). The taxonomy and distribution of members of this aggregate are still insufficiently known. Some authors prefer to treat all or most of these taxa as subspecies or varieties of R. aquaticus in the broad sense.

Rechinger (1937), may be distinguished mostly by larger and more cordate fruiting inner tepals (more than 7 mm in R. fenestratus, usually less than 7 mm in R. occidentalis), and larger achenes (3 mm, and more than 3.5 mm, respectively). The morphotype of R. fenestratus occurs mostly along the Pacific coast from central western California to Alaska. Plants with large fruiting inner tepals [known as R. fenestratus var. labradoricus Rechinger f. or R. occidentalis var. labradoricus (Rechinger f.)

Smaller plants from California have been described as var. gracilescens; they are tetraploids and sometimes were regarded as a separate species (Á. Löve and V. Everson 1967; Löve 1986). B. W. Smith (1968) showed that both diploids and tetraploids (and even exceptional spontaneous triploids and individuals with higher polyploid chromosome numbers) occur in many other localities within the range of the species; the differences in chromosome number are not strictly correlated with distribution or morphology. Narrow-leaved ecotypes of R. paucifolius reported by Smith sometimes resemble other narrow-leaved taxa of subg. Acetosella, especially R. beringensis. Rumex paucifolius and R. beringensis may be regarded as morphologically and karyologically transitional between subg. Acetosella and subg. Acetosa. Rumex paucifolius was placed in the monotypic subsect. Paucifoliae Á. Löve & N. Sarkar. Later, Löve transferred it to the segregate genus Acetosella, based mostly on the chromosome number of the species, but morphology suggests it is a member of subg. Acetosa. Probably the best solution of this problem was proposed by Smith, who noted that "the composite range of vegetative, reproductive, and karyotypic characteristics of the forty-odd species now included in the diversified subgenus Acetosa would be only slightly extended by the addition of the five species now classified as Acetosella" (p. 683)."

Schmidt ex Maximowicz, R. evenkiensis Elisarjeva). When submerging R. persicarioides as a variety of R. maritimus, Mitchell noted: "Taxonomic treatment of the group from a Eurasian point of view would undoubtedly shed light on the minor problems which we face in North and South America." However, from a Eurasian point of view (see e.g., K. H. Rechinger 1937, 1949; J. E. Lousley and D. H. Kent 1981; N. N. Tzvelev 1989b), all North American native taxa of subsect.

K. H. Rechinger (1937) provisionally determined such specimens as R. persicarioides. J. E. Dawson (1979) noted that the Pacific plants differ from Atlantic ones in having bigger tubercles (more than 1.9 × 0.7-1 mm in western plants; less than 1.9 × 0.7 mm in eastern R. persicarioides in the narrow sense), and described these large-tubercled plants as a distinct variety, "R. maritimus var. pacificus", unfortunately, an invalid name. However, that taxon seems to be extremely closely related to or possibly conspecific with the northeastern Asian species, R. ochotskius Rechinger f., which is known in eastern Asia from northern Japan to the Okhotsk Sea region of Russian Far East (especially Sakhalin and Kuril islands). The latter species also has large (to 2-2.5 mm) botuliform tubercles with obtuse apices. In the original description Rechinger stated: ""¦foliorum forma R. maritimo simillimus"¦," but N. N. Tzvelev (1989b) in his recent treatment of the genus in the Russian Far East noted that most of the specimens of R. ochotskius seen by him had leaf blades rotundate-truncate or broadly cuneate at the base. The R. persicarioides-like plants from the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada (as well as their most probable allies from eastern Asia) need additional study. At present I prefer to place them provisionally into R. persicarioides, following Rechinger's treatment."

Most infraspecific taxa show little geographic coherence, and variants representing all the infraspecific taxa can be found throughout the range of this species, sometimes mixed within single populations. High-elevation individuals tend to have very short scapes and a diminutive growth habit; lowland individuals begin flowering when the scapes are barely developed, and elongate throughout anthesis, ultimately often producing robust individuals with relatively tall scapes. Shaded areas produce plants with "long" pedicels; exposed areas produce plants with "very short" ones. The location and degree of glands and other hairs can vary widely as well. The most readily identifiable morphotype is subsp. glandulosa, seen most commonly in Arizona, southern Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas; even in it, nonglandular individuals occur together with glandular plants.

Schreber used A. coerulea (note the spelling) as did Lamarck for a related taxon that is now included within A. foemina Miller. Subsequent authors submerged A. caerulea/coerulea into A. arvensis as a forma, variety, or subspecies, incorrectly crediting either Schreber or Lamarck. L. F. Ferguson (1972) distinguished A. foemina Miller (including Schreber's A. coerulea), which consistently produces blue flowers, as a separate entity differing, in part, by petals having few to no marginal hairs, which, when present, have elongate terminal cells (in A. arvensis the petal margins have numerous gland-tipped, globose hairs), and by having flowering pedicels equaling or shorter than the subtending leaf."

Heywood 1978), Primulaceae were clearly polyphyletic, closely related to Myrsinaceae and Theophrastaceae. M. Källersjö et al. (2000) and B. Ståhl and A. A. Anderberg (2004) removed the nonrosette terrestrial members from Primulaceae in the broad sense and placed them in the Myrsinaceae, which are further distinguished by leaves and calyx often dotted with yellow or dark streaks, flowers with relatively shorter corolla tubes, seeds immersed in placentae, and wood devoid of rays or with multiseriate rays only. Maesa, consisting entirely of trees found in the Eastern Hemisphere tropics, also has semi-inferior ovaries, pedicels with two bracts, and wood with both uniseriate and multiseriate rays; it, too, was removed from Primulaceae/Myrsinaceae and placed in its own family (Källersjö et al.). The families Primulaceae in the narrow sense, Myrsinaceae, Theophrastaceae (including Samolaceae), and Maesaceae then form a monophyletic clade within Ericales (P. F. Stevens, http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/), sharing some features, most notably flowers with sympetalous corollas, stamens in a single series and opposite the petals, free-central placentation, bitegmic, tenuinucellate ovules, and plants generally with tannins and saponins.<br><br>Additional evidence (L. Martins et al. 2003) indicates that Androsace and Primula may not be monophyletic; more work is needed to resolve these issues. The work of M. Källersjö et al. (2000) showed that Douglasia should remain separate from Androsace, and Dodecatheon should remain separate from Primula, although Dodecatheon clearly is derived from Primula subg. Auriculastrum. Alternative views suggesting more inclusive concepts of Primula and Androsace have been offered by I. Trift et al. (2002), A. R. Mast et al. (2004), and G. M. Schneeweiss et al. (2004). The phylogenetic position of Cyclamen, a scapose taxon currently included in Myrsinaceae, has not been resolved. Our understanding of Primulaceae is still in flux, and future taxonomic realignments at the familial and generic levels are to be expected."

They are probably relict populations that have persisted locally since the last glacial period. These northern wild monkshoods have been treated as a species ( Aconitum noveboracense , which has had U.S. federal conservation status), or as a subspecies of A . uncinatum . We find, however, that they are part of the A . columbianum complex. They have a single daughter tuber that is separated from the parent tuber by a connecting rhizome no more than 5mm long. This is like Acolumbianum , and unlike A . uncinatum , which has several daughter tubers separated from the parent by elongate connectives. Leaf morphology is also typical of A . columbianum , and unlike A . uncinatum . Floral morphology is similar to that found in diminutive races of A . columbianum in California, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Several populations in Iowa and Wisconsin are at the diminutive extreme of the range of variation in A . columbianum floral characters such as nectary depth and hood height. Data for Iowa and Wisconsin populations can be found in D. E. Brink (1982, also 1980). Plants in an Ohio population were too stressed and depauperate for data collection. Data collected in New York populations by Brink in 1982 are not published.<br><br>Aconitum columbianum subsp. columbianum is exceedingly variable. Plants often occur in dense, highly localized populations; they are very similar morphologically within populations and within regional groups of populations. Extreme differences occur between the geographic races. Specimens of the most diminutive races rarely exceed 1 m in height, whereas plants of the largest races may exceed 3m, with correlated differences in size and number of plant parts. A complete range of variation exists between the extremes if many regional groups of populations are considered. Geographic patterns of morphologic variation have been considered too complex to accord formal taxonomic rank to the variants, so the group has been treated as one large, intergrading species complex, with bulbil-bearing and nonbulbil-bearing subspecies. White-flowered variants occur within populations, but white-flowered populations and groups of populations also occur. In each case, these seem to be sporadic variants within larger, regional patterns of morphologic variation. Consequently, white-flowered morphs are not accorded formal taxonomic rank."

Plants are most commonly assigned to two species, however. Caltha leptosepala in strict sense is found in the Rocky Mountains of Arizona and New Mexico north to Alaska and is characterized by longer-than-broad leaves with small, nonoverlapping basal lobes, solitary-flowered inflorescences, and sessile follicles. Plants in the Coast Ranges of central California north to the coastal islands of southern Alaska, distinguished by broader-than-long leaves with large, overlapping basal lobes, 2-flowered inflorescences, and stipitate follicles, have been called C . biflora . My comparison of specimens from the Rocky Mountains and the Coast Ranges indicated that no clear distinction could be made (table 1).

Typical C . palustris var. palustris is characterized by permanently erect, stout stems that do not produce roots and shoots at the nodes after anthesis. The basal leaves are broadly cordate to reniform with coarsely crenate-dentate margins and overlapping basal lobes. Generally more than three flowers occur on a stem. In contrast, C . palustris var. flabellifolia [= var. arctica , var. radicans (T. F. Forster) Beck] is characterized by stems that sprawl with age and produce roots and shoots at the nodes after anthesis. The basal leaves are Â± reniform with denticulate margins, and the basal lobes are widely divergent and do not overlap. Often fewer than three flowers occur on a stem. Caltha palustris var. flabellifolia is distributed locally throughout the range of C . palustris var. palustris ; it often grows in places with more extreme environmental conditions, such as shorelines, tidal areas, swiftly running streams and rivers, and areas with an arctic climate. Many arctic specimens can be assigned to this variety.<br><br>While Caltha palustris var. palustris and var. flabellifolia are distinctive in their extremes, they appear to represent elements along a morphologic continuum rather than recognizable taxonomic entities. For example, P.G. Smit (1973) found plants from Point Barrow, Alaska, to be dwarfed, few flowered, and prostrate, while specimens from southern Alaska were robust, many flowered, and erect. Between these two extremes a complete series of intermediates occurs. Based on that evidence, and considering the phenotypic plasticity known to exist in this species, the various specific and infraspecific segregates of C . palustris in North America are not recognized."

Denton referred her specimens to R . californicus var. cuneatus ; Brayshaw reported both varieties from the same small populations, but his data are consistent with populations of R . californicus var. cuneatus that are introgressing extensively with R . occidentalis . Although both Denton and Brayshaw treat R . californicus as a native species in that region, several reasons support the belief that it is introduced there. No reports of R . californicus in the area occur prior to 1978, although the area is quite well collected (especially Victoria, B. C. and the San Juan Islands, Washington); a long history of extensive marine trade between Victoria and San Francisco has resulted in the introduction of a number of other California species to the area; and for scattered small populations of R . californicus to have persisted for long periods in the face of free introgression from R . occidentalis seems unlikely.

In the nineteenth century R. luteola was widely growing, which favored its spreading through many parts of the world; today, it has fallen into disuse. Its potential as a crop for natural dyeing of textiles is being re-evaluated. It is also grown as an ornamental; the appealing rosettes of yellowish green leaves acquire a reddish blush in cool weather."

It also lacks the stipitate-glandular trichomes and nearly round primocane terminal leaflets of the related R. vestitus. It also often has much broader inflorescences than either of the other two introduced species.<br><br>This species, like its relatives Rubus ulmifolius and R. vestitus, can have extremely long floricane branches, sometimes in excess of 1 m, that end in flowering cymes, often appearing as if primocanes apically terminate their growth by flowering within the same year. As a result, the apical portion of long floricane branches are almost always represented in herbarium specimens, but that of true primocanes, or that of full floricanes including the adjacent portion of primocanes, are rare.<br><br>L. H. Bailey (1945), M. L. Fernald (1950), Y. Helsop-Harrison (1968), and H. A. Gleason and A. Cronquist (1991) distinguished between Rubus bifrons and another species (referred to either as R. discolor or R. procerus, both often considered synonyms of R. armeniacus), variously based upon stem shape and pubescence, prickle shape and angle, leaf shape and margins, inflorescence shape, and petal color. Plants in North America identified either as R. bifrons or the other species can have considerable variation in any of these features, even within individual stems, making it impossible to distinguish between these species.<br><br>Although Rubus discolor often has been treated as a synonym of R. armeniacus in our region, it is actually a synonym of R. ulmifolius (H. E. Weber 1985).<br><br>Although widespread in North America, plants of this species complex are most abundant from northern California northward to British Columbia (particularly coastal areas), where it is a problematic weed. Along the West Coast this species can grow in great density over large areas, often to the exclusion of all other vegetation. The fruit is desirably edible and the floral displays can be attractive."

C. H. Peck (1871) did not treat R. neglectus as a hybrid, although his description, based on material from northeastern New York, acknowledged the material to be intermediate between the two taxa.  L. H. Bailey (1945) suspected R. neglectus to be a "distinct species of local range" with no "real resemblance" to the cultivated purple raspberries.  The third author of this treatment (Gerry Moore) has observed wild purple-fruited material from northwestern New York near the type locality and concurs with L. H. Bailey that the material appears to have little resemblance to the cultivated purple raspberries.  The fruit of this material has a strikingly distinct taste, Peck noting that the locals referred to it as "cream berries."  Further study of this material is needed to better understand the proper application of the name Rubus neglectus and whether or not this name can be applied to hybrids between R. idaeus subsp. strigosus and R. occidentalis.  M. L. Fernald (1900) misapplied the name R. idaeus Linnaeus var. anomalus Arrenhius to reduced, unarmed sterile material of Rubus idaeus subsp. strigosus with simple leaves on the floricane; this material was later described by Blanchard as R. egglestonii.

Although these character states occur in the eastern Asian S. betulifolia, it has very different leaf architecture, which appears to be unique and not found in any North American taxa.

Until further research is conducted on the distinctiveness of these infraspecific taxa, we will recognize G. serpenticum at the species level only.<br><br>Dempster and Ehrendorfer: "The name G. serpenticum circumscribes a rather polymorphic assemblage of diploid and some tetraploid races having many characters in common and often so tightly connected by transitional forms that further specific subdivision seems impossible....It is possible that the pattern here outlined may be the result of primary geographical and ecological differentiation which has become blurred by secondary hybridizations. The disjunct group of western montane races may represent the remnants of an older, more grayanum-like northward push along the Cascades, which has become fractionated and more or less strongly infiltrated by eastern and central races during times of dryer and more continental climate."

While formal recognition of the three races is appealing, they are actually very difficult or impossible to separate morphologically and have strongly overlapping ranges. Some of the variability may be due to environmental modification (D. B. O. Savile 1964; G. W. Argus 1973; J. H. Soper and J. M. Powell 1985). On Attu Island, Alaska, there are plants to 2 m along with dwarf plants (C. Parker, pers. comm.). Their tall stature cannot be accounted for by habitat alone.

However, one specimen from Okanogan County annotated as S. farriae by George Argus in 2005.  <br><br>FNA7: "Salix farriae is a cordilleran species ranging from Wyoming to central British Columbia with disjunct occurrences in northwestern British Columbia, western Northwest Territories, and southern Yukon. It is related to S. hastata, an amphiberingian species ranging from Scandinavia to southwestern Yukon and northwestern Northwest Territories. There may be reasons for treating these slightly different plants as S. hastata var. farriae, but R. D. Dorn (1975) maintained them as a species based on flavonoid differences. In a phenetic study (G. W. Argus 2007), the two taxa had dissimilarity values at the same level as other closely related species. They are treated here as species, primarily because their ranges are disjunct. They can be separated as follows:<br><br>Salix farriae is distinguished from S. hastata by having largest medial blades narrowly elliptic to elliptic, pistillate nectaries oblong or ovate, stipules on early leaves absent or rudimentary (sometimes foliaceous), branches strongly to weakly glaucous or not, floral bract apices rounded, and plants of the cordillera in Alberta and British Columbia, in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming; S. hastata has largest medial blades narrowly elliptic to broadly elliptic or broadly obovate, pistillate nectaries square, stipules on early leaves foliaceous (sometimes rudimentary), branches not glaucous, floral bract apices acute or rounded, and plants of Alaska, Northwest Territories, and Yukon.<br><br>Salix farriae and S. barclayi are sympatric in western Canada and the Pacific Northwest, where they are difficult to separate. Salix farriae can often be recognized by its largest medial leaves with at least some minute, ferruginous hairs on the adaxial midrib or blade surfaces; ferruginous hairs do not occur in S. barclayi. Its leaf margins also tend to be more nearly entire, but relatively short teeth are not infrequent. Such plants are sometimes interpreted as intergrades between S. farriae and S. barclayi (R. D. Dorn 1975). The variable leaf toothing also occurs in S. hastata and may not be a reliable indicator of intergradation. Salix farriae also differs from S. barclayi in usually having shorter anthers, 0.3-0.6 mm versus 0.6-1 mm in S. barclayi. See 61. S. barclayi."

It was treated by G. W. Argus (1973) and R. D. Dorn (2000) in a broad sense because of an absence of strong distinguishing characters and intergradation in characters that could be used to divide it. It is highly variable and three very similar taxa have been named: S. amplifolia, S. hookeriana (including vars. tomentosa and laurifolia), and S. piperi. Although extremes of these taxa sometimes are recognizable, the intergradation displayed is so great that even attempts to recognize them as varieties are thwarted. The amplifolia  variant in Alaska is characterized by having only white leaf hairs, hairy ovaries, no stipules, and catkins often borne on distinct flowering branchlets, but variation can occur within the same population, and typical S. hookeriana on Vancouver Island sometimes displays the same characteristics. The piperi variant, an inland population in western Oregon and Washington, is usually recognized by local botanists as different from coastal populations. It is characterized by leaves and branchlets soon becoming glabrate and stipules prominent. These characteristics, however, sometimes appear in northern California coastal populations, and some inland populations in Oregon include very hairy individuals that are indistinguishable from coastal variants of S. hookeriana. In general, very hairy populations of S. hookeriana are probably an adaptation to marine coastal environments, but some variation may be due to hybridization and introgression with S. scouleriana. Inland populations suggest the influence of S. lasiolepis. Two hexaploid chromosome numbers reported for S. hookeriana from Vancouver Island (R. L. Taylor and S. Taylor 1977) and Queen Charlotte Islands (R. L. Taylor and G. A. Mulligan 1968), British Columbia, indicate that hybridization has played a role in the evolution of this complex. It is possible that each variant of S. hookeriana has had a different, possibly even recurrent, polyploid origin. Further cytological and genetic study is indicated.<br><br>The following comparisons may help to distinguish Salix hookeriana, S. lasiolepis, and S. scouleriana.<br><br>Vegetative specimens of Salix hookeriana can be distinguished from S. lasiolepis by having floral buds ellipsoid, beaks distinctly long-tapered, densely long-hairy (villous), red-brown, blades usually pilose, villous, or woolly on abaxial surfaces, usually 18-63 mm wide, and 1.5-4.2 times as long as wide; S. lasiolepis has floral buds ovoid, beaks inconspicuous and blunt, sparsely to moderately densely short-hairy (velvety), yellowish to red-brown, blades usually tomentose on abaxial surfaces, usually 6-32 mm wide, and 3.2-9.6 times as long as wide.<br><br>Salix hookeriana is distinguished from S. scouleriana by having branchlets with spreading hairs (woolly or tomentose to glabrate), petioles usually pilose to tomentose, blades typically narrowly elliptic but variable, stigmas 0.3-0.74, short in relation to styles (0.6-2.3 mm), and pistillate nectaries 0.5-1.4 mm, shorter or longer than stipes; S. scouleriana has branchlets usually with short, erect hairs (velutinous), sometimes spreading (villous or tomentose), petioles velvety or villous adaxially, blades typically oblanceolate but variable, stigmas 0.4-1.04 mm, long in relation to styles (0.2-0.6 mm), and pistillate nectaries 0.2-0.8 mm, shorter than stipes.<br><br>Hybrids:<br><br>Salix hookeriana forms natural hybrids with S. barclayi and S. scouleriana. Variation in some S. hookeriana populations suggests hybridization with S. lasiolepis but no positive identifications have been made. R. D. Dorn (2000) doubted that hybridization in California between these species with different chromosome numbers was possible, but species with different chromosome numbers do hybridize [for example, S. athabascensis (4x) × S. pedicellaris (2x)]; synthetic hybridization studies are indicated.<br><br>Salix hookeriana × S. scouleriana: Plants from southern British Columbia with leaves similar to S. hookeriana but with prominent stipules, catkins both erect and recurving, and relatively long stigmas were thought by J.

One of the most common of western North American shrubs in alkaline habitats, S. vermiculatus grows among other shrubs or in pure stands, often to great extent, especially in the Great Basin. It is frequently codominant with Allenrolfea in areas that support little else. Other, less alkali-tolerant associates may include species of Artemisia (even A. tridentata), Atriplex, Chrysothamnus, Grayia, Krascheninnikovia, Larrea, and Suaeda. Sarcobatus vermiculatus ranks among the important western browse plants, but it has a dark side. Range animals and wildlife feed on it; the plant's saline taste perhaps enhances its palatability. Under certain conditions, poisoning of animals, especially sheep, may result from the plant's content of sodium and potassium oxalates (10-22% of plant dry weight). Death may occur when sheep eat large amounts of S. vermiculatus---and little or nothing else---in a short time. A notable mass poisoning of sheep occurred in 1920 when 1700 ewes in transit were unloaded and allowed to browse in a pure stand of S. vermiculatus. The next morning 1000 were dead (J. M. Kingsbury 1964). Sarcobatus vermiculatus is allegedly a phreatophyte; its taproots are said to be able to penetrate as much as 57 feet below the surface. Large communities of greasewood coincide with areas where the water table is less than 15 feet below the surface, although the plant can survive with water table depth to 25 feet (H. N. Mozingo 1987)."

In Oregon, it occurs in the coastal lowlands and inland mountains of Curry and Josephine counties northward to Tillamook County. It is introduced on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, and in southern Washington. It may form relatively large stoloniferous colonies on mountain slopes or meadows and in coastal lowlands, or in shallow streams and seepage bogs. The flowers are initiated in the fall and overwinter in the bud stage, protected by the bracts. The fruits mature in late summer to fall, with seed dispersal continuing throughout the winter. The long papillae on the seeds allow flotation.<br><br>Darlingtonia californica is stunning in the wild, eagerly sought for cultivation, and difficult to grow outside its cool native range. It was discovered in 1841 on the Wilkes Expedition by the assistant botanist, W. D. Brackenridge, growing in a marsh bordering a tributary on the Sacramento River south of Shasta Peak. It is currently threatened by road building, draining, logging, ranching, drought, and unscrupulous collectors. Darlingtonia and some eastern American species of carnivorous plants have been transplanted into sites in northern California and the Pacific Northwest."

It is naturalized in Skagit County, Washington.<br><br>Sarracenia flava is a striking plant, often forming large stands, at least historically. It is much less common with the advent of drainage and changing land use. It has one main flush of pitchers in spring to early summer.

The number of populations has been severely reduced by development and fire suppression. Its spring pitchers are not as robust or profuse as the late-summer pitchers, the latter especially attracting moths. This species responds well to winter fires, resulting in abundant growth later that spring. In some managed areas, the attractive tubes are judiciously harvested and sold, fresh or dried, as "cut flowers" in florist shops. Pure white pitchers (no colored veins) with red petals or totally anthocyanin-free individuals with yellow petals occur.<br><br>Capsules of Sarracenia leucophylla dehisce acropetally rather than basipetally as in all other species in the family. G. W. Folkerts and D. R. Folkerts (1989) hypothesized that this adaptation allows seeds to be released with less likelihood of being caught and held by the persistent style discs."

Sarracenia occurs mainly in the southeastern United States, with one species (S. purpurea) occurring northward and westward across Canada to British Columbia, and naturalized in Switzerland, the British Isles, and Japan. Heliamphora Bentham, a tropical genus with about 15 species, is endemic to the Guayana Highlands of northern Brazil, western Guyana, and southern Venezuela. All species are characteristic of moist-to-wet, open, sunny, low-nutrient, acidic habitats.<br><br>The evolutionary origins and relationships of the Sarraceniaceae are obscure, and there is only one (highly questionable) fossil record (Li H. Q. 2005). Molecular data suggest Ericalean affinities (R. J. Bayer et al. 1996). Some authors have suggested that Heliamphora is primitive in the family (B. Maguire 1978) because its pitcher structure is less complex. All three genera have specializations, and their pitcher morphologies are likely affected by adaptations to their wet environments and carnivorous habits. Because we cannot reliably ascertain which taxa are primitive in this family, the genera and species are presented in alphabetic order."

Moore, both sister to Micranthes. Mort and Soltis considered the ovary of Cascadia to be superior because the two carpels are distinct to their bases; the hypanthium, fused to each carpel, gives the ovaries a semi-inferior appearance.

Cronquist 1981; H. G. A. Engler 1930; J. Hutchinson 1973; G. K. W. Schulze-Menz 1964b; A. L. Takhtajan 1997; R. F. Thorne 1992). Molecular phylogenetic data (D. R. Morgan and D. E. Soltis 1993; Soltis et al. 1993, 2001; Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 1998, 2003) reveal that genera of Saxifragaceae in the broad sense are allied with at least ten separate, often distantly related families of flowering plants. These data also suggest that Saxifragaceae in the narrow sense as treated here consists of about 38 genera worldwide, equivalent to subfamily Saxifragoideae, one of the 15 subfamilies recognized by Engler and one of the 17 recognized by Schulze-Menz of the broadly defined Saxifragaceae. Molecular phylogenetic data (Soltis et al. 2001) show that the narrowly defined Saxifragaceae fall into two major groups: Saxifraga, and the heucheroid clade encompassing all other genera. Molecular data further show that Saxifraga, as traditionally understood, is polyphyletic, comprising two distinct lineages (treated here as Saxifraga and Micranthes) and the monospecific North American Cascadia. The major split between Saxifraga and the heucheroid clade is supported not only by molecular data from six DNA regions but by differences in patterns of floral morphology. Saxifraga has a relatively uniform floral morphology (radially symmetric flowers, with bilateral symmetry restricted to one Asian group of species, which consistently have the same number of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels). Almost all of the variation in the family in numbers of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels occurs in the heucheroid clade. Radially symmetric flowers predominate there, but some bilateral flowers are found in Bensoniella, Micranthes, Tolmiea, and some species of Heuchera."<br><br>NOTE: Past and contemporary research have indicated that Mitella is a polyphyletic group best treated as multiple genera.  The treatment here reflects that view, which is also consistent with how these taxa were treated by Abrams in "Illustrated Flora of the Pacific States".<br><br>FNA8: "Mitella is treated here in the broad sense; phylogenetic data indicate that it is polyphyletic (D. E. Soltis et al. 1990; Soltis and R. K. Kuzoff 1995). Historically, four or five genera have been recognized (including Mitella, Ozomelis Rafinesque, Pectiantia Rafinesque). Formal restructuring of generic boundaries is complicated by the presence of nearly a dozen Asian species (M. Wakabayashi 2001) and lack of a comprehensive understanding of the genus relative to the rest of Saxifragaceae. Mitella nuda and M. diphylla, both with ten stamens, form a clade that would comprise a narrowly defined Mitella. A second clade composed of M. diversifolia, M. stauropetala, M. trifida, and Conimitella williamsii would form a second, distinct genus. Molecular data suggest that M. breweri, M. caulescens, and M. pentandra also form a distinct clade and perhaps a third, distinct genus. The relationships of M. ovalis are less certain; some analyses suggest that it may be sister to the genus Tolmiea (Soltis and Kuzoff; Kuzoff and Soltis, unpubl.)." <div style="position: fixed; left: -4096px"><a href="http://www.dalamantransfers.co.uk">dalaman transfers</a></div>

Parietaria hespera is usually more delicate and has thinner leaves with the proximal pair of lateral veins arising at the junction of blade and petiole. Leaf shape and texture tend to overlap in the two species, but in P . pensylvanica the proximal pair of lateral veins clearly arise above the junction of blade and petiole. The extremes of P . pensylvanica frequently are found where the ranges of the two species approach or overlap. Examples of these intermediates are from Gila, Mohave, and Yuma counties, Arizona. A mixed collection from Rock Springs, Gila County, Arizona, suggests that the two species occasionally grow together."

H. Grayum 1987). Other than the absence of a close association with Arales, the phylogenetic affinities of Acoraceae remain unclear. Evidence based on DNA sequences fails to show any close relationships between Acorus and other genera, and instead supports Acorus as the oldest extant lineage of monocotyledons (M. R. Duvall et al. 1993).<br><br>The removal of Acorus from Araceae is supported by the absence of a spathe and the unique vasculature of the structure traditionally interpreted as a spathe (T. S. Ray 1987). The structure that has been called a spathe in Acorus is not morphologically equivalent to the spathe of Araceae; instead it is interpreted as the distal part of the sympodial leaf. The proximal part of the sympodial leaf is adnate to the peduncle, forming a 3-angled axis that bears the inflorescence.

It is unknown in the wild and is probably derived from A. oschanini of central Asia. The cultivated form is often polyploid (2n = 16, 32, 54) and possibly of hybrid origin. It exists in numerous cultivars, a few of which form large bulbils in the umbel."
4602	2012-08-06 09:52:00	Fred Weinmann	Vascular Plants: Monocots	Amaryllidaceae	122160	Allium cernuum		species		Y	N	N	N	N	N	N	Native		{"Herbarium":"WTU"}	FNA26"Allium cernuum is the most widespread North American species of the genus. It is closely related to A. stellatum, and the character commonly used to differentiate them has been umbel orientation. In both species, the inflorescence is nodding in bud, but in A. stellatum it usually becomes erect by anthesis. In A. cernuum the peduncle remains permanently recurved near the apex, although the inflorescence may sometimes become erect overall, or nearly so. While this character is helpful in identification, an almost exclusive reliance on it (even by one of the present authors in his youth) has obscured other clearer distinctions between the species and has confused their geographic ranges. More reliable characters for differentiating these species are bulb shape (elongate in A. cernuum, ovoid in A. stellatum) and perianth shape (campanulate in A. cernuum, stellate in A. stellatum). Unfortunately, perianth shape is often difficult to see in herbarium specimens."

Until the variation can be worked out along natural lines, if any, instead of unstable features such as plant size, and color and shape of the tepals, recognition of these varieties is unsound. Because we are unable to separate native populations from many of the escaped ones, we cannot reliably map the native distribution of this taxon in the flora."

The morphologic variation shows no geographic or ecologic pattern and cannot be separated consistently by visual or statistical analyses. The most frequently recognized taxa, C. densa and C. dudleyi, are end-points along a morphologic continuum of spongy tissue development. The perigynium of typical C. densa has well-developed spongy tissue, giving an ovate shape and rounded base. In contrast, the typical C. dudleyi lacks development of spongy tissue, giving a rhombic shape and tapered base. These extremes are connected by a continuous range of intermediate forms that display the same range of variation found in C. vulpinoidea. A single species is here recognized; however, further study may clarify patterns of biological variation within the complex taxon."

Carex jonesii is frequently confused with other western montane sedges that have capitate infloresences.

Yeo (1980), have included Eleocharis coloradoensis in E. parvula or E. parvula var. anachaeta. In typical E. coloradoensis, which occurs from Saskatchewan south to Kansas and in California to 2100 m elevation, the achenes are usually distinctly rugulose or rough, often pitted-cellular, their apices usually truncate, and the tubercles are usually brown, often rudimentary, clearly distinct from the achene, and apparently partly sunken into the achene summit. Some plants from the southern Great Plains to the Mexican border, including the type of E. parvula var. anachaeta from Louisiana, may deserve taxonomic recognition. They differ from typical E. coloradoensis in having nearly smooth achenes with the apex tapered to a tubercle that is difficult to distinguish from the achene. C. L. Gilly (1941) separated these plants as E. membranacea (Buckley) Gilly; application of that name is doubtful because achenes are lacking from the type. R. R. Yeo (1980) studied the life-history of E. coloradoensis in the Sacramento Valley, California, and showed that it can be used to control several aquatic weeds in irrigation canals. The n = 4 count reported from Kansas under E. parvula var. anachaeta (Anonymous 1964) and on voucher specimens at GH and UC, is probably erroneous; the label on a duplicate voucher specimen at NDA includes the information "n = 3 II's + a chain of IV" (i.e., n = 5).

It is known from near sea level on the coasts of British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec (James Bay and Magdalen Islands); Alaska, California, Oregon, and Washington. Some plants are intermediate between variant c and variant b. Several specimens I have seen from far eastern Russia are very similar to American plants of Eleocharis macrostachya, variant c.

This form has often been treated as a distinct species, S. rubricosus (or under the illegitimate name S. eriophorum Michaux). These two morphologies intergrade so extensively that it is not practical to recognize them taxonomically at any rank.<br><br>Scirpus cyperinus often hybridizes with S. atrocinctus and S. pedicellatus, forming hybrid swarms. Some plants appear to have characteristics of all three species; the names Scirpus atrocinctus var. grandis Fernald and S. atrocinctus forma grandis (Fernald) D. S. Carpenter are based on such a specimen."

Growth and spread often are rapid. Stem fragments become rooted by fine, unbranched adventitious roots and soon produce vegetative reproductive structures from both subterranean and erect stems. Tubers produced on subterranean stems are pale brown; those produced on erect stems are dark olive-green and covered with short, stiff scales. Both types germinate quickly to produce new stems."

There is correspondingly wide variation in a number of characters, which has caused much confusion as to taxonomic circumscription. Homer Metcalf (pers. comm.) made a detailed study of this species. The basic requirement for its success seems to be an extremely wet area before flowering and then almost desertlike conditions for the rest of the summer. In large populations, sometimes covering hundreds of acres, Iris missouriensis may be found with either simple or branched stems, leaves from 4 mm to more than 1 cm wide, shorter than the stem or longer, only one flower to as many as three on a stem, and colors from deep blue to almost pure white. A single plant found on the Pariah Plateau in Kane County, Utah, with leaves only 3–4 mm wide and a single flower stem only 4 cm long, which meant that the flower was at almost ground level, was named Iris pariensis. No other such specimen has been located, and this entity must be considered as just an aberrant form that was due to the desertlike conditions in which it was growing."

However, extreme variability in spurs and their development can lead to a single plant "simulating all three varieties" (Sheviak 2002b). There is limited geographic sorting of the three proposed varieties, all of which are found in the same habitats and have broadly overlapping ranges in western North America. "Intermediates and populations with variable spur lengths are abundant" (Sheviak 2002b). Luer (1975) also questioned the taxonomic validity of the varieties, even as he was proposing a new combination for one of them. Wallace (2003) suggested the species is "actively evolving" but failed to find molecular markers or consistent physical features to further resolve the three proposed varieties. We suggest more work is needed before the varieties can be reliably separated morphologically and recognized taxonomically.
5238	2013-12-12 08:24:00	Peter F. Zika	Vascular Plants: Monocots	Orchidaceae	131995	Platanthera dilatata var. leucostachys		infraspecies		Y	N	N	N	N	N	N	Native		{"Herbarium":"WTU"}	FNA26: " Platanthera dilatata traditionally has been divided on the basis of spur length into three varieties, one of which, var. leucostachys, is sometimes treated as a distinct species. These infraspecific taxa seem to reflect differing pollination pressures. The moderate spur length and diurnal fragrance of var. dilatata suggests adaptation to diurnal Lepidoptera; the long spurs and primarily nocturnal fragrance of var. leucostachys indicates specialization for moth pollination, and the short spurs and often broader viscidia of var. albiflora suggest a broader range of pollinators or, in extreme cases, specialization for bee or fly pollination. Alone, these characteristics might support recognition at the specific level, but intermediates and populations with variable spur lengths are abundant. In some plants in western Canada, in particular, spurs that are very short when the flower is young grow to equal the lip as the flower ages, and in some they may eventually greatly exceed the lip, thereby simulating all three varieties. Plants with short spurs, either thick or variably slender, occur occasionally across the range of the species. In the southern Rocky Mountains spur reduction reaches an extreme, yet populations with moderate-length spurs occur there as well. In the broad sense, then, P. dilatata forms a cohesive unit in which spur length varies greatly, apparently in response to differing pollination pressures. The northwest is the center of variability of the species, and as it ranges eastward through the boreal forest, and southward down the Rockies and the more western ranges, it appears to have specialized for different pollinators. The recognized varieties of P. dilatata are evidentally merely endpoints in a very complex variation pattern. They have some utility for discussion purposes, but they are very simplistic representations of the underlying situation. Variety leucostachys and, to a lesser extent, var. dilatata appear to be real entities that have emerged from a background of variability that continues to produce similar plants. This variability is here treated within var. albiflora.<br><br>Platanthera dilatata hybridizes with P. huronensis and P. purpurascens, and perhaps also does so with other related species; see the note under 10. P. aquilonis."

Difficult to distinguish from Platanthera aquilonis. Platanthera hyperborea, the name formerly used for members of this complex in the PNW, is a poorly understood species endemic to Greenland and Iceland. We follow FNA for taxonomy and treat the authorship of H. hyperborea as (L.) R. Br. in Ait., Hort. Kew. ed. 2. 5: 193 (1813); not (L.) R. Br. ex Ait. f. as in KZ.<br><br>FNA26: "Northwestern plants commonly treated as Platanthera hyperborea var. viridiflora (Chamisso) Kitamura (note Kitamura's priority over Luer) are P. huronensis; Chamisso's name furthermore is synonymous with P. stricta. Aleutian and coastal Alaskan plants are often short, stout, and broad-leaved, and they have incorrectly been referred to 9. P. convallariifolia.<br><br>Platanthera huronensis as here delimited does not auto-pollinate in the manner of P. aquilonis. Occasional plants and populations that may be referable to P. huronensis, however, exhibit the movement of pollinia typical of P. aquilonis. These plants might reflect infraspecific variation within an allotetraploid species, result from hybridization, or constitute a distinct taxon. The relationship of some of these plants to P. hyperborea needs study. Platanthera huronensis is typically intensely fragrant with the sweet, pungent scent of some related species. Platanthera huronensis is known to hybridize with P. dilatata; it may hybridize with other species as well. Although hybrids of P. dilatata and P. aquilonis may occur, the name traditionally used for them, P. ×media (Rydberg) Luer is a synonym of P. huronensis. See notes under 10. P. aquilonis and 8.

It is also said to be densely few-flowered, although some Siberian material is comparable to American plants. Supposedly intermediate plants are reported from Alaska, and much material from that area is reduced in stature and with smaller flowers than typical of American plants. In most cases, however, lips are relatively slender, and the plants seem merely to be stunted by their environment. One or two collections from the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutians, however, seem entirely referable to subsp. oligantha with dense, few-flowered inflorescences of very small flowers with rhombic-lanceolate lips and shorter curved spurs. Eurasian plants are reported to be hexaploid or perhaps sometimes triploid, and if the apparent ploidy differences delimit the taxa, then it should be possible to unequivocally identify Alaskan plants."

FNA does not map Platanthera sparsiflora north of the Siskiyou Mountains, suggesting all WA reports (e.g., H&C from Skamania Co., and WNHP from Skamania, Yakima, Chelan & Whatcom Cos.) were misidentifications of the notoriously variable Platanthera stricta. Further work is needed support reports of Platanthera sparsiflora from Washington.<br><br>FNA26: "The plants here treated as Platanthera stricta have in common more or less saccate spurs, orbiculate viscidia, and leaves that abruptly diverge from the stem, often at angles approaching 90Âº (this feature is sometimes obscured in sheltered, deeply shaded habitats). The plants described as P. gracilis Lindley are florally typical of the slender-spurred extreme of P. stricta; they differ only in peculiarly reduced, slenderly oblong but nonetheless abruptly wide-spreading leaves. The plants figured by C. A. Luer (1975) as P. hyperborea var. gracilis (Lindley) Luer are not referable to P. stricta but rather are apparently hybrids of P. stricta and P. dilatata. Critical study of the description of Habenaria borealis var. viridiflora Chamisso and an evident isotype show this plant to be referable to P. stricta, although the name has been applied to P. huronensis in the Northwest and to P. convallariifolia in Japan.

In some areas, however, especially at the edges of the range of the species, some variation is apparent and is sometimes coincident with variability in ploidy level. In particular, in California and adjacent southwestern Oregon variability reaches its peak, with plants variously exhibiting yellowish flowers, loosely spiraled inflorescences, and spreading lateral sepals.

Maze (1981) noted that, at one site, A. hendersonii was restricted to areas subject to frost heaving, although under cultivation, it can grow without such disturbance. He hypothesized that its survival in such sites is attributable to a competitive advantage gained by the structure of its root system. Unlike Poa secunda, which grew in the surrounding, undisturbed areas, the outer cortex and epidermis of the roots of A. hendersonii form a sheath around the stele and inner cortex. When the roots are pulled, this sheath slips and breaks but the internal structures remain intact. In Poa secunda, the outer part of the root is attached to the central core and, when the roots are pulled, they break.

Its distribution tends to be more northern and coastal where ditches and pond margins are common habitats, and its stolons enable it to form loose mats. Agrostis gigantea is ecologically adapted to a more extreme climate—hot summers/cold winters and drought—than A. stolonifera. It is also similar to A. capillaris and A. castellana; it differs from both in its longer ligules, from A. capillaris in its less open panicles with spikelets near the base of the branches, and from A. castellana in being more extensively rhizomatous.<br><br>When Agrostis gigantea grows in damp hollows under trees it becomes more like A. stolonifera, particularly when the inflorescence is young, not expanded, and pale.

Although E. virginicus and E. curvatus overlap greatly in range, E. curvatus usually has a distinct growth form, and its anthesis is 1–2 weeks later (Brooks 1974). Its spikes range from being completely exserted, especially west of the Great Plains, to largely sheathed, especially east of the Mississippi River and in more stressed environments. This geographic trend parallels that within E. virginicus, but sheathed plants of E. curvatus can usually be distinguished by their short awns. Clear transitions to E. virginicus, usually var. jejunus, are rare, but, especially from Missouri to Wisconsin, there are occasional plants with 5–10 mm awns on a few lemmas, especially at the spike tips. Rarely, plants from Missouri and Iowa to Quebec have hispid to hirsute spikelets, suggesting introgression with E. virginicus var. intermedius.

It grows well in disturbed sites, spreading rapidly via its long rhizomes, as well as by seed. It is also drought tolerant. Although it is listed a noxious weed in several states, it provides good forage. It differs from E. hoffmannii in having widely spaced, unequally prominent leaf veins and, usually, shorter awns.<br><br>Godley (1947) demonstrated that lemma awn development, glaucousness, and the pubescence of the rachises are each effectively controlled by single genes. Long-awned plants are homozygous recessive, and awn-tipped plants homozygous dominant; glaucousness is dominant over non-glaucousness, and glabrous rachises over pubescent rachises. Awned plants appear to be established along the coasts of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. They have generally been identified as Agropyron pungens (Pers.) Roem. & Schult., a species that has obtuse, mucronate lemmas.<br><br>Elymus repens is almost always a hexaploid. Most studies indicate that its genomic constitution is StStH, but Mason-Gamer (2001) demonstrated that it is genetically more complex than is implied by such a simple formula."

It is often confused with E. elymoides, but differs from that species in having only one spikelet per node, wider glumes, and more tardily disarticulating rachises. It also resembles E. sierrae, from which it differs in its disarticulating rachises, denser spikes, and shorter anthers.<br><br>Several taxonomists have suggested that Elymus scribneri consists of fertile hybrids between E. violaceus and E. elymoides.

Plants with glumes having 5–7 well-developed, narrowly spaced veins are restricted to lower elevations and the southern portion of the subspecies range; northern plants and plants at higher elevations generally have 3–5 weakly developed and widely spaced veins. The former glumes resemble those of E. glaucus, with which E. trachycaulus subsp. trachycaulus is often sympatric; the latter, those of E. violaceus. Spikelet spacing also varies considerably.

It is treated here as including E. alaskanus subsp. latiglumis [&#8801; Agropyron latiglume], E. alaskanus being restricted to plants with relatively short glumes that are often found in valleys and at lower elevations than E. violaceus. Western plants of E. violaceous tend to be more glaucous, have shorter spikes and spikelets, and more obovate glumes than plants from Greenland but, until more is known about the extent and genetic basis of the variation in and among E. violaceus, E. alaskanus, and E. trachycaulus, formal taxonomic recognition seems inappropriate."

It is invading vernal pools in California.<br><br>In western North America, G. declinata has been confused with G. ×occidentalis. The most reliable distinguishing characteristics are the lateral lemma lobes of G. declinata and its rather short, straight panicle branches. The two species also differ in their ploidy level, G. declinata being diploid and G. ×occidentalis tetraploid (Church 1949). This is reflected in the length of their guard cells, those of G. declinata being 0.2–0.3 Âµm and those of G. ×occidentalis being 0.4–0.5 Âµm.<br><br>S.F. Hrusa found plants (Hrusa 13681, 15858, 16267; specimens in CDA) that have an annual growth habit.

It differs from other species in the region primarily in its longer lemmas and anthers. Studies of chloroplast DNA in western North American species of Glyceria demonstrated that, contrary to C.L. Hitchcock's (1969) conclusion, G. fluitans is present in western North America, and that all specimens being identified as G. ×occidentalis had cpDNA resembling that of G. leptostachya or G. fluitans; there was no distinctive G. ×occidentalis cpDNA (Whipple et al.

Pascopyrum smithii is probably derived from a Leymus triticoides–Elymus lanceolatus cross (Dewey 1975); it is frequently confused with both. Leymus triticoides differs in usually having 2 spikelets per node and glumes that are narrower at the base. In E. lanceolatus, the leaves tend to be more evenly distributed and the glumes have straight midveins, become narrow beyond midlength, and tend to be wider at 3/4 length (0.35–1.6 mm). In addition, the first rachilla internodes of E. lanceolatus are often longer and narrower (the length/width ratio averaging 2.6, versus 1.8 in P. smithii). No infraspecific taxa of P. smithii are recognized here."

It was also collected by Farwell in Keenewaw County, Michigan in 1895 (Voss 1972). It grows on medium-textured soils in arid and semiarid steppe, shrub-steppe, and open woodland communities, and was one of the dominant species in grassland communities of the Columbia and Snake river plains (Daubenmire 1939, 1960). It is still an important forage plant in the northern portion of the Intermountain region. Several cultivars have been developed.<br><br>Rhizomatous plants are favored in relatively moist habitats, and cespitose plants in dry habitats (Daubenmire 1960). Daubenmire noted that rhizomatous plants produce few inflorescences and, possibly for this reason, are collected less frequently than cespitose plants. Daubenmire also found that awn length varies continuously within plants grown from seed. He concluded that the ability to produce rhizomes and unawned plants is heritable, that the two characters are not linked, and that the form which becomes dominant at a local site is determined by environmental conditions.<br><br>The unawned phase tends to be more restricted in its distribution than the awned phase, being dominant in the native grasslands of southern British Columbia, eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northern and eastern Oregon; the awned phase is found throughout the range of the species. Many populations include awned and unawned plants, as well as some that have poorly developed awns on some lemmas. Awned autotetraploid populations grow in mesic grassland and woodland communities of the hills and mountains of southern British Columbia and eastern Washington.<br><br>Based on informal observations, plant breeders working with Pseudoroegneria spicata consider that awn presence is determined by a single major gene, and modified by some minor genes. The unawned condition is apparently dominant, as seed from crosses of heterozygotic, diploid, unawned parents gives rise to around 50% awned offspring.<br><br>The above observations make it clear that the awned and unawned phases of Pseudoroegneria spicata are of little taxonomic significance, despite their evident morphological difference. If it is considered necessary to distinguish between them, the awned phase can be called Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve forma spicata and the unawned phase P. spicata forma inermis (Scribn. & J.G. Sm.) Barkworth.<br><br>Plants with densely pubescent leaves are known from the east slope of the Cascade Mountains in Washington. Plants with nearly as densely pubescent leaves are found elsewhere in southern Washington and northeastern Oregon. Such pubescent plants may be called Pseudoroegneria spicata forma pubescens (Elmer) Barkworth.<br><br>Pseudoroegneria spicata used to be confused with Elymus wawawaiensis, from which it differs in its more widely spaced spikelets and wider, less stiff glumes. The two species are geographically sympatric, but P. spicata grows in medium- to fine-textured loess soils, and E. wawawaiensis in shallow, rocky soils. Pseudoroegneria spicata may also be confused with Elymus arizonicus, particularly with immature specimens of that species or specimens mounted so that they appear to have erect, rather than drooping, spikes. It differs in having shorter, truncate ligules and generally thicker culms than E. arizonicus, and in having a distribution that extends much further north.<br><br>Pseudoroegneria spicata has been suggested as one of the parents in numerous natural hybrids with species of Elymus in the Flora region. These hybrids are usually mostly sterile, but development of even a few viable seeds permits introgression to occur, as well as the formation of distinctive populations. It is often difficult to detect such hybrids, particularly if they involve the unawned form of Pseudoroegneria. The named hybrids are treated under ×Pseudelymus (p. ??). Others are discussed under the Elymus parent."

Zika	Vascular Plants: Monocots	Potamogetonaceae	161076	Potamogetonaceae	Ruppiaceae	family		N	N	N	N	N	N	N	Native			FNA22: "The family has historically been considered to consist of two genera, Potamogeton and Groenlandia. Recent molecular evidence (D. H. Les, unpublished), combined with existing morphologic evidence, indicates that Potamogeton in the broad sense actually represents two separate lineages. We recognize those lineages at the generic level, Potamogeton in the strict sense and Stuckenia. Consequently, we accept three genera in the family, Potamogeton, Stuckenia, and Groenlandia.<br><br>Reproductive features are most important in separating species of Potamogeton (R. R. Haynes 1978), and we include the entire family here. The keys may not always utilize reproductive features, but they are based on fruiting individuals. We strongly recommend that no one collect specimens of Potamogetonaceae that are lacking reproductive structures.<br><br>Leaves of Potamogetonaceae are stipulate. The stipules form a tubular sheath (stipular sheath) around the stem, free from or adnate to the base of the blade. In some species the leaf and sheath of submersed leaves are adnate for part of their length, and the leaf appears to have a sheathing base with an adaxial ligule at the junction of sheath and blade or petiole.<br><br>Fruits of Potamogetonaceae are drupaceous. The fruits do have endocarps but do not have fleshy mesocarps. Mesocarps exist but never become fleshy. Consequently, the fruits are not true drupes, they are drupaceous.<br><br>Many species of Potamogetonaceae undergo extensive vegetative reproduction either by turions or stem fragmentation. Turions are excellent modes of vegetative reproduction. The structures are produced at the stem tips and eventually fall to the substrate, either by a portion of the stem breaking off or by the stem itself falling to the substrate. The turions survive an unfavorable season, germinate, and grow into new plants during the next growing season. Because the unfavorable season is usually winter in North America, turions have been called "winter buds." At least one species, Potamogeton crispus, produces turions in early summer, and the turions survive the unfavorable season (summer, in this instance), germinating in the fall. The plant then survives the winter as a young individual, only a few centimeters long, even under ice, and begins growth as the water warms in the following spring. "Winter bud" is certainly not the correct term for P. crispus. The term "turions" designates all such structures, regardless of the unfavorable season."

Hotchkiss and H. L. Dozier (1949), Typha domingensis was generally included within T. angustifolia in North America. Because of many misidentified specimens, range expansion in recent years, and undercollecting, the distribution on the margins of the main range is somewhat uncertain. Many literature reports are based on misidentified specimens. Some workers suggested T. angustifolia was early introduced from Europe into Atlantic Coastal North America and migrated westward (R. L. Stuckey and D. P. Salamon 1987). In recent decades it has expanded its range in many regions and become much more abundant, especially in roadside ditches and other highly disturbed habitats. For example, although it was known only from one Wisconsin station in 1929 (N. C. Fassett 1930) and was very local in Iowa in 1939 (A. Hayden 1939), it is now common and widespread in both states. As it often out-competes many native marsh species to produce very dense, pure stands, and hybridizes with T. latifolia to form the probably even more competitive T. &#61620;glauca, T. angustifolia and T. &#61620;glauca should perhaps be classified as noxious weeds in parts of North America. Beyond the main range of T. angustifolia, there are specimens of T. &#61620;glauca from north-central Montana (Phillips County.), west-central Manitoba (La Pas), and Anticosti Island, Quebec. There are m Many erroneous reports have come from outside of Europe and North America. For hybrids see also genus and key."

In addition to the WA specimens, it has recently (2017) been collected along the Columbia River in Oregon.  Whether these populations should be considered range expansions of a native species or dispersal events of an introduced species can't be clearly resolved with the information currently available.<br><br>FNA22: "Typha domingensis probably should be treated as a highly variable pantropic and warm temperate species, occurring to 40º E north and south latitude worldwide, and needing study to determine infraspecific taxa and delimitation from related species (B. G. Briggs and L. A. S. Johnson and B. G. Briggs 1968; S. G. Smith 1987)."

Undoubtedly native throughout its North American range, where it is often a codominant or minor component of marshes, wet meadows, fens, and other communities. In many places it is apparently being replaced by T. angustifolia and T. angustifolia &#61620; T. latifolia (T. &#61620;glauca) at least partly due to human disturbance of habitats. There is a specimen of T. xglauca from Anticosti Island, Quebec. Locally in California and perhaps elsewhere where hybrids are common, the pollen grains of some T. latifolia plants separate slightly and may be shed partly as mixtures of triads, dyads, and monads, perhaps due to introgression ([S. G. Smith, unpublisheddeletion.). Ph.D. thesis]. See also hybrids in key and genus."

Because Z. americana resembled a previously published species, it was suggested the name should be placed in synonymy, at least until further study could be undertaken of at least the ecology and genetics of the complex (R. C. Phillips and R. F. Shaw 1976; P. G. Harrison 1976). A proposal that Z. americana was synonymous with Z. noltii was based upon the identical or overlapping ranges of most characteristics (R. C. Phillips and R. F. Shaw 1976). Zostera noltii is native to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa and to the Mediterranean Sea area. Therefore, the suggestion implies that Z. noltii has been introduced into North America. No mode of introduction was discussed, however.<br><br>Similarly P. G. Harrison (1976) suggested an introduction of an exotic species, but he suggested Zostera japonica instead. A study of populations of Z. americana from Boundary Bay, south of Vancouver, British Columbia revealed no obvious differences between those plants and individuals of Z. japonica and Z. noltii. A comparison of the British Columbia specimens with illustrations by C. den Hartog (1970) of both Z. japonica and Z. noltii indicated the British Columbia plants resembled more the illustrations of Z. japonica than those of Z. noltii. A discussion of possible modes of introduction noted that a brown alga, Sargassum muticum, was introduced into the North American Pacific coast area with seed oysters. Zostera japonica occurs in areas where the oysters were obtained in Japan, and oysters were packed in Zostera species during shipment. Such shipments were possibly the means by which the species was introduced into North America. Harrison's explanation is quite plausible, and I am accepting it until further research solves the problem."

It extends southward to North Carolina in the Atlantic and Baja California in the Pacific. At the southern limits of its range, active growth mostly is in the cooler months of autumn and spring, with flowering and fruiting mostly in the spring and the plants dying in the hotter summer months, the vegetation becoming dislodged from the substrate and floating to the water surface. The fruits apparently remain in the floating vegetation for a period of time, eventually falling from the shoots to the substrate. Movement in dislodged vegetative material is the only adaptation the fruits have for dispersal (C. den Hartog 1970).<br><br>The species is found mostly in the sublittoral region, only rarely being exposed at low tide. It occurs in more or less sheltered areas on soft mud or firm sand. Plants of sandy substrates had narrower leaves than plants growing on muddy substrates (C. H. Ostenfeld 1905). Fruits fall from the floating vegetation to the substrate and settle on the substrate ripple marks, which run more or less perpendicular to the direction of current. Seedling establishment is parallel with the ripple marks, forming vegetated ridges separated by depressions, which gradually fill with sediments, and the plants then grow laterally into them, forming a meadow (C. den Hartog 1970). The vegetation lowers the velocity of current flow, causing some suspended particles to settle out and accumulate around the base of the plants, slowly building the substrate. As more particles accumulate, the substrate gets deeper over the rhizomes, since the rhizomes grow horizontally, not vertically. Eventually, the rhizomes are too deep, and the plants begin to die back, a phenomenon followed by erosion."
