Abies lasiocarpa and A . amabilis , however, are separated by many morphologic features, and no hybrids have been found (W.H. Parker et al. 1979)."

They are probably relict populations that have persisted locally since the last glacial period. These northern wild monkshoods have been treated as a species ( Aconitum noveboracense , which has had U.S. federal conservation status), or as a subspecies of A . uncinatum . We find, however, that they are part of the A . columbianum complex. They have a single daughter tuber that is separated from the parent tuber by a connecting rhizome no more than 5mm long. This is like Acolumbianum , and unlike A . uncinatum , which has several daughter tubers separated from the parent by elongate connectives. Leaf morphology is also typical of A . columbianum , and unlike A . uncinatum . Floral morphology is similar to that found in diminutive races of A . columbianum in California, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Several populations in Iowa and Wisconsin are at the diminutive extreme of the range of variation in A . columbianum floral characters such as nectary depth and hood height. Data for Iowa and Wisconsin populations can be found in D. E. Brink (1982, also 1980). Plants in an Ohio population were too stressed and depauperate for data collection. Data collected in New York populations by Brink in 1982 are not published.<br><br>Aconitum columbianum subsp. columbianum is exceedingly variable. Plants often occur in dense, highly localized populations; they are very similar morphologically within populations and within regional groups of populations. Extreme differences occur between the geographic races. Specimens of the most diminutive races rarely exceed 1 m in height, whereas plants of the largest races may exceed 3m, with correlated differences in size and number of plant parts. A complete range of variation exists between the extremes if many regional groups of populations are considered. Geographic patterns of morphologic variation have been considered too complex to accord formal taxonomic rank to the variants, so the group has been treated as one large, intergrading species complex, with bulbil-bearing and nonbulbil-bearing subspecies. White-flowered variants occur within populations, but white-flowered populations and groups of populations also occur. In each case, these seem to be sporadic variants within larger, regional patterns of morphologic variation. Consequently, white-flowered morphs are not accorded formal taxonomic rank."

It is known from only three counties: Yakima and Kittitas counties, Washington, and Crook County, Oregon. Maze (1981) noted that, at one site, A. hendersonii was restricted to areas subject to frost heaving, although under cultivation, it can grow without such disturbance. He hypothesized that its survival in such sites is attributable to a competitive advantage gained by the structure of its root system. Unlike Poa secunda, which grew in the surrounding, undisturbed areas, the outer cortex and epidermis of the roots of A. hendersonii form a sheath around the stele and inner cortex. When the roots are pulled, this sheath slips and breaks but the internal structures remain intact. In Poa secunda, the outer part of the root is attached to the central core and, when the roots are pulled, they break. Achnatherum hendersonii also differs from P. secunda in having relatively few (9–12), evenly distributed roots that extend to 30 cm."

Some taxonomists have argued that true Antennaria alpina does not occur in North America, because none of the North American material exactly matches the type of A. alpina, which is from Lapland (M. O. Malte 1934; A. E. Porsild 1965). If one uses a strict typological species concept, then this is true; I recognize that this species complex is composed of innumerable apomictic clones and am circumscribing a broad species concept for A. alpina. The potential morphologic overlap between the A. media and A. alpina complexes is a major taxonomic problem. The chief difference between members of the two complexes is the presence of prominent flags on cauline leaves in A. alpina and their absence in A. media. Antennaria alpina of North America is gynoecious and characterized by its dark green to black phyllaries and conspicuous flags on the distal cauline leaves. The basal leaves vary from glabrous, as in the type material, to pubescent. The primary progenitors of the A. alpina complex include A. aromatica, A. densifolia, A. friesiana subsp. alaskana, A. friesiana subsp. neoalaskana, A. monocephala subsp. monocephala, and A. pulchella."

Schreber used A. coerulea (note the spelling) as did Lamarck for a related taxon that is now included within A. foemina Miller. Subsequent authors submerged A. caerulea/coerulea into A. arvensis as a forma, variety, or subspecies, incorrectly crediting either Schreber or Lamarck. L. F. Ferguson (1972) distinguished A. foemina Miller (including Schreber's A. coerulea), which consistently produces blue flowers, as a separate entity differing, in part, by petals having few to no marginal hairs, which, when present, have elongate terminal cells (in A. arvensis the petal margins have numerous gland-tipped, globose hairs), and by having flowering pedicels equaling or shorter than the subtending leaf."

It is the most common species of Androsace across western North America and is variable in morphology, depending on elevation, exposure, and light. This plasticity has resulted in a plethora of infraspecific names. Most infraspecific taxa show little geographic coherence, and variants representing all the infraspecific taxa can be found throughout the range of this species, sometimes mixed within single populations. High-elevation individuals tend to have very short scapes and a diminutive growth habit; lowland individuals begin flowering when the scapes are barely developed, and elongate throughout anthesis, ultimately often producing robust individuals with relatively tall scapes. Shaded areas produce plants with "long" pedicels; exposed areas produce plants with "very short" ones. The location and degree of glands and other hairs can vary widely as well. The most readily identifiable morphotype is subsp. glandulosa, seen most commonly in Arizona, southern Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas; even in it, nonglandular individuals occur together with glandular plants. Given the lack of coherence in morphological variation within A. septentrionalis and its environmental variation, it seems best to view the complex as a single, highly variable species."

One might logically choose either of two taxonomies: recognizing only two species in the entire genus, one representing subg. Artorhiza and the other subg. Balsamorhiza, or recognizing each slightly differing population as a species. Either course results in an unsatisfactory classification. The present classification is a compromise. A knotty problem persists. A central cluster of populations from eastern Washington to southeastern California display a number of minor and locally discrete morphologies. They tend to be less isolated from each other than are the peripheral populations, although some tend to mimic the latter ones in one or more characteristics. Their evolutionary history may be involved with past hybridizations with each other or with species of subg. Artorhiza, gene drift, and polyploidy.

Recent changes to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (W. Greuter et al. 1994) have clarified the situation, however, and the consensus now is that the earlier name is correct. E. Hultén (1968) believed that the species in Alaska that has been called B . occidentalis consists of an extensive hybrid swarm between B . neoalaskana (as B . resinifera ) and B . glandulosa . The studies of J. R. Dugle (1966) do not support a hybrid origin of B . occidentalis in other parts of its range.

Plants from the south are larger, have pale brown pistillate scales, and serrulate perigynium beaks. Northern plants are smaller, have medium brown pistillate scales, and smooth perigynium beaks. These characteristics are only weakly correlated, making it difficult to assign individuals to these taxa except in a very arbitrary manner. When recognized, the southern plants are called subsp. capillaris (C. chlorostachya Steven, C. capillaris var. major Drejer ex Blytt), and the northern plants are called subsp. fuscidula (V. I. Kreczetovicz ex T. V. Egorova) Á. Löve & D. Löve.<br>T. V. Egorova (1964) recorded the Asian species Carex delicata C. B. Clarke (as C. karoi) from Colorado; no specimens have been seen that confirm that report, and it seems likely an error because T. V. Egorova (1999) indicated the species is restricted to Asia. This species has dense lateral spikes with 15–30 perigynia, the perigynia rounded at the apex and abruptly beaked, with the beak 0.1–0.2 mm.<br>Carex tiogana D. M. Taylor & J.

The morphologic variation shows no geographic or ecologic pattern and cannot be separated consistently by visual or statistical analyses. The most frequently recognized taxa, C. densa and C. dudleyi, are end-points along a morphologic continuum of spongy tissue development. The perigynium of typical C. densa has well-developed spongy tissue, giving an ovate shape and rounded base. In contrast, the typical C. dudleyi lacks development of spongy tissue, giving a rhombic shape and tapered base. These extremes are connected by a continuous range of intermediate forms that display the same range of variation found in C. vulpinoidea.

Carex jonesii is frequently confused with other western montane sedges that have capitate infloresences. It is most often confused with C. illota due to the strong similarity of the perigynia (somewhat shorter and more rounded apically in C. illota). Although C. illota is placed in sect.

A. Calder and R. L. Taylor 1965 and B. Boivin 1967–1979). Three morphotypes probably warrant formal taxonomic recognition.

That phase is quite uniform and occurs throughout much of the continent, extending south to the uplands of North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, South Dakota, New Mexico, and California. Small plants from Alaska, Yukon, Alberta, British Columbia, and eastward, var. tayloris, are extremes of the phase.<br><br>The most distinct variant, Carex leptalea subsp. harperi [C. harperi, C. leptalea var. harperi], has longer [3.4–4.9(–5.4) mm], more slender perigynia that overlap more strongly and are subtended by whitish scales. Its spikes are, on the average, longer, and its achenes are sharply angled. The phase occurs from Florida to Texas, north to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Missouri. Various authors have reported it from farther north, but it is doubtful whether subsp. harperi occurs beyond the range given.<br><br>Carex leptalea subsp. pacifica [C. jimcalderi] resembles subsp. harperi in its longer perigynia [(3–)3.4–4.7 mm)] and proximal pistillate scales with the midvein excurrent into a cusp or awn, but differs in its brown-margined scales and obtusely angled achenes.

Typical C . palustris var. palustris is characterized by permanently erect, stout stems that do not produce roots and shoots at the nodes after anthesis. The basal leaves are broadly cordate to reniform with coarsely crenate-dentate margins and overlapping basal lobes. Generally more than three flowers occur on a stem. In contrast, C . palustris var. flabellifolia [= var. arctica , var. radicans (T. F. Forster) Beck] is characterized by stems that sprawl with age and produce roots and shoots at the nodes after anthesis. The basal leaves are Â± reniform with denticulate margins, and the basal lobes are widely divergent and do not overlap. Often fewer than three flowers occur on a stem. Caltha palustris var. flabellifolia is distributed locally throughout the range of C . palustris var. palustris ; it often grows in places with more extreme environmental conditions, such as shorelines, tidal areas, swiftly running streams and rivers, and areas with an arctic climate. Many arctic specimens can be assigned to this variety.<br><br>While Caltha palustris var. palustris and var. flabellifolia are distinctive in their extremes, they appear to represent elements along a morphologic continuum rather than recognizable taxonomic entities. For example, P.G. Smit (1973) found plants from Point Barrow, Alaska, to be dwarfed, few flowered, and prostrate, while specimens from southern Alaska were robust, many flowered, and erect. Between these two extremes a complete series of intermediates occurs. Based on that evidence, and considering the phenotypic plasticity known to exist in this species, the various specific and infraspecific segregates of C . palustris in North America are not recognized."

It is a loosely arranged aggregate of still insufficiently understood races. Hundreds of segregate microspecies and infraspecific entities (including nomenclatural combinations) of the C. album aggregate have been described and/or recognized by various authors. Some authors have recognized numerous segregate intergrading species, while others have developed elaborate infraspecific hierarchies with numerous subspecies, varieties, forms, and even numerous subforms (e.g., B. Jüttersonke and K. Arlt 1989), or have combined both approaches. Neither approach has brought satisfactory and uncontroversial results.<br><br>It is evident that most recent evolutionary processes within the group were greatly affected by anthropic factors, including extensive recent invasions, hybridization between previously geographically isolated taxa, poly-ploidy, intensive selective processes and mutagenesis in synanthropic habitats, gene drift, and so forth. All of these modern factors further complicated the taxonomic situation. Consequently, no infraspecific taxa are formally recognized in the present treatment. We attempt, however, to outline below the most common or noteworthy groups currently placed in Chenopodium album sensu lato. Although we list such groups under binomials, they should be considered here as informal groupings rather than accepted species.<br><br>It should be also kept in mind that many enigmatic and deviant forms of the Chenopodium album aggregate are in fact hybrids with other (occasionally several) species, and between infraspecific entities. C. album hybridizes with C. suecicum (producing C. ×fursajevii Aellen & Iljin), C. opulifolium (producing C. ×preissmannii Murr), C. strictum [producing C. ×pseudostriatum (Zschacke) Murr], C. ficifolium (producing C. ×jedlickae Dvorák or C. ×zahnii Murr), C. berlandieri (producing C. ×variabile Aellen), and some other species."

These plants are very variable, and usually have broader leaves and more lax inflorescences, which might be a result of hybridization with other species of the C. album aggregate. The native status of such forms is very questionable. Typical C. strictum also occurs in North America, but seems to be less common. Some narrow species and hybrids of the C. strictum aggregate are recognized in Eurasia (P. Aellen 1928; F. Dvo ák 1989; P. Uotila 1977, 1993, 1997). Some of these taxa, especially C. striatiforme Murr and C. novopokrovskyanum (Aellen) Uotila, are superficially similar to the native North American taxa of subsect. Leptophylla. Eurasian forms of the C. strictum group usually can be distinguished by their venation pattern (in most cases more than three visible veins even in narrowest leaves).

Intermediates with var. odontolepis are known through much of that range."<br><br><br>"Cirsium remotifolium occurs from the Coast Ranges and valleys of the Pacific Northwest to the western slopes of the Cascade and Klamath ranges, south in the California North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay region. It is closely related to the C. clavatum complex of the Rocky Mountains region. Both have a similar growth habit and some forms variably express the character of broadly scarious, lacerate-toothed phyllary margins. Gray, in naming Cnicus carlinoides var. americanus, included as syntypes both California and Colorado specimens. F. Petrak (1917) treated both the West Coast plants and those of the Rocky Mountains as Cirsium subsect. Americana, recognizing C. remotifolium with several infraspecific taxa plus two other species, C. callilepis and C. amblylepis from the West Coast, and four additional species from the Rocky Mountains. A. Cronquist (1955) rejected Petrak's subspecies, treating C. remotifolium in a restricted sense, limited to plants of Washington and Oregon without dilated phyllary tips, and circumscribed C. centaureae broadly to include the Rocky Mountains and West Coast plants with dilated phyllary tips. Because of the frequent presence of dilated phyllary tips in C. remotifolium in the restricted sense, Cronquist acknowledged the likelihood of past introgression with C. centaureae in the broad sense.<br><br>J. T. Howell (1960b) recognized three species: Cirsium remotifolium, C. acanthodontum, and C. callilepis, the latter with four varieties collectively corresponding to the West Coast representatives of C. centaureae (in the sense of Cronquist). Because of the great similarity of the various West Coast plants and their intergradation, I see no value in recognizing two or more species.<br><br>The West Coast and Rocky Mountains plants are clearly related, but are separated by the Great Basin region and there is little chance of current genetic interchange. As is often the case with American Cirsium, genetic enrichment from past hybridization with other nearby species within their respective areas has likely been fertile ground for evolutionary diversification. Different species have contributed genes in the Pacific states and in the Rockies. I have chosen to recognize two geographically-based species complexes, each with intergrading races here treated as varieties.

It occurs in scattered localities in the Rocky Mountains and northeastern Great Basin region. At least some of the few widely scattered records from the eastern United States are probably introductions. Cirsium undulatum  is both widespread and variable. Plants of the Great Plains region tend to be low-growing with a few large heads and elongate corollas. Plants of the Pacific Northwest are usually taller and produce smaller, more numerous heads with shorter corollas. A detailed study of this species might reveal races worthy of recognition as infraspecific taxa.<br><br>Wavyleaf thistle is listed by California as a noxious weed. However, most reports of Cirsium undulatum in California are based upon misidentifications of C. canescens. Cirsium undulatum is known to hybridize with C. flodmanii, C. hookerianum, and C. scariosum var. coloradense. J. T. Howell (1960b) reported that C. undulatum was suspected to hybridize with C. brevifolium in the Pacific Northwest."

A variegated form of C. communis var. ludens, forma aureostriata MacKeever, occurs spontaneously and has been noted from Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia."

Putative hybrids with C. villosum reported in FNA.<br><br>FNA4: "Corispermum pacificum seems to be closely related to Siberian C. crassifolium Turczaninov and C. maynense Ignatov. The latter species occurs in the northeastern Russian Far East and may be expected to occur in Alaska. Corispermum pacificum differs from C. maynense by its usually more robust habit, and its wing rounded (rarely rounded-truncate or indistinctly emarginate, but not triangular) at apex. From C. crassifolium it may be distinguished by the constant presence of perianth segments, and more flattened black mature fruits. Corispermum pacificum probably also occurs in adjacent regions of British Columbia. Corispermum pacificum is placed in subsect. Crassifolia (S. L. Mosyakin 1997). This subsection seems to be of Siberian origin, with its central species, C. crassifolium, being closest to the hypothetic ancestral taxon. The presence of perianth segments in C. pacificum may be explained by ancient hybridization with representatives of subsect. Pallasiana.<br><br>Reproductive isolation between the sympatric species of Corispermum may be achieved by different flowering periods. Occasional hybrids between C. pacificum and C. villosum are similar in their habit to C. pacificum in having usually broad leaves and rather dense inflorescences but they have mostly aborted fruits suggesting that C. pacificum and C. villosum are taxonomically distant species."

Such plants, which tend to have smaller spikelets and pilose foliage, have been called D. spicata var. longipila Scribn. & Merr. The terminal inflorescence is usually primarily cleistogamous, but plants with chasmogamous inflorescences are found throughout the range of the species. Chasmogamous plants differ in having divergent inflorescence branches at anthesis, larger anthers, and well-developed lodicules."

D. nivalis for differences). Some of the infraspecific taxa of D. lonchocarpa are based on trivial characteristics and are listed in the synonymy above without further comment. The most problematic are briefly discussed below.<br><br>Authors recognizing var. vestita claim that it differs from var. lonchocarpa by having pubescent (versus glabrous) stems and pedicels, 1- or 2-leaved (versus 0 or 1-leaved) scapes, and fruits appressed (versus not appressed) to the rachises. These characteristics do not appear to be strongly correlated. A case in point is the holotype sheet of var. semitonsa, which includes plants with puberulent or glabrous fruits, as well as with pubescent and glabrous stems that are 0-4-leaved. Leafless and densely pubescent scapes are found in Trelease 3913 (MO), whereas completely glabrous, 0-2-leaved stems, and fully appressed fruits are found in Calder 5617a (DAO).

Indeed, a casual observation would immediately justify the recognition of var. thompsonii. Both fruit types can be found in plants of the same population (e.g., the RSA isotype) or even on the same plant (e.g., Thompson 10816, MO). Furthermore, fruits to 2.5 mm wide occur sporadically in various parts of the species range.

Submerged, usually nonflowering plants are abundant throughout much of the range of the species (H. K. Svenson 1929; P. E. Rothrock and R. H. Wagner 1975). They have been called E. acicularis forma fluitans (Doellinger) Svenson; E. acicularis forma inundata Svenson; E. acicularis forma longicaulis (Desmazières) Hegi; E. acicularis forma submersa (Nilsson) Norman; and E. acicularis var. submersa (Nilsson) Svenson. The culms of the submerged plants are terete, smooth, soft to flaccid, translucent, and the partitions of the air cavities within are clearly visible. Submerged plants may closely resemble aquatic forms of some other species, especially Eleocharis parvula, E. robbinsii, and Schoenoplectus subterminalis (Torrey) Sojak (N. C. Fassett 1957; E. G. Voss 1967, 1972–1996, vol. 3).<br><br>Although E. acicularis is very variable, recognition of varieties is premature pending a worldwide taxonomic revision of subg. Scirpidium. Much of the variation is apparently due to phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental factors, especially water depth (P. E. Rothrock and R. H. Wagner 1975). The named varieties intergrade extensively, and achenes, which are important in defining the varieties, are often absent. H. K. Svenson (1929) recognized four varieties and two forms for North America, but later (1957) did not recognize infraspecific taxa. "

Macbr. was published in 1918; the name Atriplex dioica Raf. was published in 1817.<br><br>FNA4: "The distribution of the species is evidently bipartite, with an eastern coastal series extending northward mainly from New Jersey to Newfoundland and along the St. Lawrence seaway, and perhaps extending to James Bay of Hudson Bay. The western grouping lies mainly west of the 95th meridian of longitude, where it has been collected since early historical times to the present in saline marshes or other saline sites from the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories, southward to southern California, northern Arizona, northern New Mexico, and Oklahoma.<br><br>Rafinesque gave the following information: "Stem upright angular branched, leaves petiolate, deltoid, acute, thick, scaly, the proximal opposite toothed, the distal alternate, hastated, entire: flowers dioical glomerate, male spiked naked, female unequal, sepals deltoid, warty-crested."<br><br>The name Atriplex dioica Rafinesque antedates Chenopodium subspicatum Nuttall by half a year, being published in December 1817. Hence, it is the correct name for the widely ranging species, which has passed most recently under the name A. subspicata. Nuttall's description of the habitat of Chenopodium subspicatum is: "In saline soils around Mandan Village, Missouri," a designation of habitat that applies to this day.<br><br>The species forms a mirror-image set of specimens with the remarkably similar Atriplex prostrata, from which it may be distinguished in most cases by the thickened, merely ovate to lanceolate leaf blades, and less commonly but in some localities exclusively triangular-hastate to lanceolate, mostly scurfy and prominently 3-veined leaf blades. In some specimens, including the types of both Chenopodium subspicatum and Atriplex carnosa, the blades bear a hastate lobe at or above the base and sometimes match triangular-hastate profile of A. prostrata. The leaves of A. prostrata are typically thin-textured, green, not scurfy, and the veins of the blade are obscure. I. J. Bassett et al. (1983) disallowed within A. dioica (as A. subspicata) any but those with lanceolate blades, including those with the proximalmost leaves with a pair of subbasal hastate lobes. However, there are numerous specimens in which the blades are thickened and transitional in that regard to the triangular-hastate profile as in A. prostrata. Certainly those specimens with triangular or triangular-hastate leaves taken prior to the introduction of A. prostrata sometime late in the nineteenth or early twentieth century, clearly belong to the indigenous A. dioica. Whether there are intermediates between diploid (2n = 18) A. prostrata and tetraploid or hexaploid (2n = 36, 54) A. dioica is not known. There does not seem to be any consistent feature or combination of features by which all specimens can be assigned to one or the other of the two taxa.

In the Bitterroot Mountains (Ravalli and Deerlodge counties, Montana), short-stemmed, blue-rayed plants also have strigose cauline vestiture (in contrast to typically deflexed-hirtellous stems); these vestiture variants occur in the same area with plants apparently similar in all other features. Strigose populational variants also occur in Saskatchewan and Yukon, and E. abajoensis, largely distinguished by strigose cauline vestiture, might be considered a regional variant of E. caespitosus.

Until further research is conducted on the distinctiveness of these infraspecific taxa, we will recognize G. serpenticum at the species level only.<br><br>Dempster and Ehrendorfer: "The name G. serpenticum circumscribes a rather polymorphic assemblage of diploid and some tetraploid races having many characters in common and often so tightly connected by transitional forms that further specific subdivision seems impossible....It is possible that the pattern here outlined may be the result of primary geographical and ecological differentiation which has become blurred by secondary hybridizations. The disjunct group of western montane races may represent the remnants of an older, more grayanum-like northward push along the Cascades, which has become fractionated and more or less strongly infiltrated by eastern and central races during times of dryer and more continental climate."

Without evidence to the contrary, these populations are considered introduced to these localities.  Creso includes G. tricornutum in her 1984 flora of western Washington and describes it as rare in waste places and fields.  In the absence of specimens indicating its presence here in WA, we are considering G. tricornutum to be excluded from the flora at this time.

In Europe, it grows in low-calcium, acidic soils and tolerates drier conditions than other European species of Glyceria (Conert 1992). In Denmark, it tends to grow in areas that are highly trampled (Niels Jacobsen and Signe Frederiksen, pers. comm.). It is invading vernal pools in California.<br><br>In western North America, G. declinata has been confused with G. ×occidentalis. The most reliable distinguishing characteristics are the lateral lemma lobes of G. declinata and its rather short, straight panicle branches. The two species also differ in their ploidy level, G. declinata being diploid and G. ×occidentalis tetraploid (Church 1949). This is reflected in the length of their guard cells, those of G. declinata being 0.2–0.3 Âµm and those of G. ×occidentalis being 0.4–0.5 Âµm.<br><br>S.F. Hrusa found plants (Hrusa 13681, 15858, 16267; specimens in CDA) that have an annual growth habit. Apart from this, they fit within the circumscription of G. declinata, except that two of the three specimens have narrower (2–3 mm) leaves than normal; they were also collected relatively early in the season. For now, it seems best to include the plants in G. declinata pending a better understanding of their relationship to perennial members of the species."

Its wide distribution over much of the north temperate zone has provided ample opportunity for secondary contact between G . dryopteris and each of its diploid parents, thereby resulting in a wide-ranging composite of abortive-spored triploid crosses ( G . disjunctum × G . dryopteris and G . appalachianum × G . dryopteris ). These relationships are shown on the diagram. Sterile triploid plants are not restricted only to areas where the range of the tetraploid overlaps with that of either diploid. Their broad distribution could be explained in part by their spores, which are of two types: malformed, black, and with very exaggerated perispores, or round with extensive netted perispores (K. M. Pryer and D. M. Britton 1983). The latter spore type is capable of germination and presumably permits the plants to reproduce apogamously. The name G . × brittonianum (Sarvela) Pryer & Haufler has been applied to the G . disjunctum × G . dryopteris hybrid formula (K. M. Pryer and C. H. Haufler 1993). The type of G . × brittonianum has aborted and round spores, and leaves that strongly resemble those of G . disjunctum . They are large, 3-pinnate-pinnatifid, and the second and third pairs of pinnae are sessile with basal basiscopic pinnules markedly longer than the basal acroscopic pinnules. Sterile triploid plants with a morphology similar to the type of G . × brittonianum are frequent. The biology of both of these cryptic hybrid taxa needs further study, which should lead to detailed morphologic descriptions and distribution maps.<br><br>Gymnocarpium dryopteris also hybridizes with both G . jessoense subsp. parvulum and G . robertianum ."

It is known from the type collection along the Spokane River Valley east of Spokane, Idaho, and two down-river, atypical collections (Benton and Spokane counties, Washington).

Zika	Vascular Plants: Monocots	Iridaceae	129111	Iris missouriensis		species		Y	N	N	N	N	N	N	Native		{"Herbarium":"WTU"}	FNA26: "The ecological range of Iris missouriensis is probably more varied than that of any other North American species of the genus, extending from almost sea level in southern California to 3000 m in Montana and Wyoming. There is correspondingly wide variation in a number of characters, which has caused much confusion as to taxonomic circumscription. Homer Metcalf (pers. comm.) made a detailed study of this species. The basic requirement for its success seems to be an extremely wet area before flowering and then almost desertlike conditions for the rest of the summer. In large populations, sometimes covering hundreds of acres, Iris missouriensis may be found with either simple or branched stems, leaves from 4 mm to more than 1 cm wide, shorter than the stem or longer, only one flower to as many as three on a stem, and colors from deep blue to almost pure white. A single plant found on the Pariah Plateau in Kane County, Utah, with leaves only 3–4 mm wide and a single flower stem only 4 cm long, which meant that the flower was at almost ground level, was named Iris pariensis. No other such specimen has been located, and this entity must be considered as just an aberrant form that was due to the desertlike conditions in which it was growing."

K. Small 1914), two subspecies (R. L. Taylor and B. MacBryde 1978), or two varieties (J. E. Ebinger 1974). A flavonoid study (S. Liu 1993) indicated that the Pacific lowland (from Washington to Alaska) var. occidentalis populations are hardly separable from the alpine var. microphylla populations. The flavonoid data cited in support of combining K. microphylla and K. occidentalis are unpublished and impossible to judge. In any case, one would not expect varieties to necessarily differ chemically; the morphological and ecological differences seem sufficient.<br><br>The two varieties of Kalmia microphylla are generally distinct; var. microphylla is common in alpine meadows of western North America from California through the Rocky Mountains into northern Canada and Alaska. The elevations at which it is found range from an average 2500 meters (1500-3500 m) in California to an average 1700 meters (900-2200 m) in Alberta, British Columbia, and Washington. Variety occidentalis, in contrast, is always encountered growing below 900 meters, being common in coastal areas and islands off the coast of Alaska and British Columbia. These two varieties are known to hybridize (J. E. Ebinger 1974), and the hybrids are highly fertile and set large quantities of viable seed (R. A. Jaynes 1988).<br><br>Variety occidentalis and Kalmia polifolia are strikingly similar. Both have the same general habit and size and are very similar in most morphological characteristics. These taxa are easily separated by the revolute leaf margins and small stalked glands along the leaf midrib in K. polifolia, which are lacking in var. occidentalis (J. E. Ebinger 1974).

The latter has obovate fruits widest beyond the middle, whereas L. apetalum has elliptic fruits widest at the middle.<br><br>The number and limits of the varieties recognized in Lepidium densiflorum, as well as the characters used to delimit them, vary among authors (A. Thellung 1906; C. L. Hitchcock 1936; G. A. Mulligan 1961; R. C. Rollins 1993; N. H. Holmgren 2005b). The variation almost always does not correlate with geography, and the recognition of varieties in this species is neither practical nor very useful. All of those authors admitted that these varieties are "very weak at best" (Rollins, p. 554). Of them, perhaps var. pubicarpum (including var. elongatum) might merit recognition. It is distributed in almost all of the Mountain and Pacific states and is distinguished from the other varieties solely by the presence of trichomes or minute papillae on the fruit valves. The density of these trichomes ranges from moderate and covering the entire valve surface to very sparse and represented by individual papillate trichomes restricted to the valve margin. Furthermore, the length of these trichomes may vary from ca. 0.01 to 0.3 mm. In some species (e.g., L. dictyotum) both glabrous- and pubescent-fruited forms occur, yet none of the above authors gave formal recognition to both forms. It is not known if both glabrous and puberulent fruits occur within the same population in L. densiflorum. The species is autogamous, but nothing is known about the rates of gene flow between and within populations."<br><br>Rollins, 1993: "The original area of L. densiflorum sens. lat. is impossible to know because of its weedy tendencies.

In some collections (e.g., Scoggan 4233, GH; Boivin et al., 13221, GH), both puberulent- and glabrous-fruited forms occur. It is almost certain that the same situation exists not only in other populations of this species, but in other North American Lepidium. It is also clear that some populations might consist entirely of one of the two forms, but it is highly unlikely that this variation has any geographical basis. Therefore, we believe that the separation of varieties solely on the basis of presence or absence of the fruit trichomes is taxonomically meaningless."

However, Ducharte's (1871) recapitulation of a letter from M. Leichtlin is apparently the first confirmed and valid publication of L. columbianum, and hence that citation is used here.<br><br>This widespread lily is rather variable. In California plants the stamens are considerably less exserted than those of plants found farther north. Lilium columbianum may intergrade with L. kelloggii along Highway 199 at the border between California and Oregon; these plants are slightly fragrant, the stamens moderately exserted, and the bulb scales unsegmented. Lilium columbianum hybridizes with L. pardalinum subspp. wigginsii and vollmeri, and extensively with L. occidentale in Oregon."

They assign our material to var. nephrophylla. Their key separates the two proposed varieties on the basis of leaf shape, lip length, and flower color, while stating "the distinction is not sufficient to maintain the varieties." Magrath and Coleman (2002) also overlook the floral variation mentioned in H&C, yet another reason to combine the varieties, which we do here, following the treatment in JPM and other regional manuals.

Because Z. americana resembled a previously published species, it was suggested the name should be placed in synonymy, at least until further study could be undertaken of at least the ecology and genetics of the complex (R. C. Phillips and R. F. Shaw 1976; P. G. Harrison 1976). A proposal that Z. americana was synonymous with Z. noltii was based upon the identical or overlapping ranges of most characteristics (R. C. Phillips and R. F. Shaw 1976). Zostera noltii is native to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa and to the Mediterranean Sea area. Therefore, the suggestion implies that Z. noltii has been introduced into North America. No mode of introduction was discussed, however.<br><br>Similarly P. G. Harrison (1976) suggested an introduction of an exotic species, but he suggested Zostera japonica instead. A study of populations of Z. americana from Boundary Bay, south of Vancouver, British Columbia revealed no obvious differences between those plants and individuals of Z. japonica and Z. noltii. A comparison of the British Columbia specimens with illustrations by C. den Hartog (1970) of both Z. japonica and Z. noltii indicated the British Columbia plants resembled more the illustrations of Z. japonica than those of Z. noltii. A discussion of possible modes of introduction noted that a brown alga, Sargassum muticum, was introduced into the North American Pacific coast area with seed oysters. Zostera japonica occurs in areas where the oysters were obtained in Japan, and oysters were packed in Zostera species during shipment. Such shipments were possibly the means by which the species was introduced into North America. Harrison's explanation is quite plausible, and I am accepting it until further research solves the problem."

True N . tetragona is absent from northeastern North America and, now, from the conterminous United States, where this name has usually been applied to what is here segregated as N . leibergii . In size and shape of leaves and flowers the two taxa are very similar. They differ in the leaf mottling often present in developing leaves of N . tetragona but absent in N . leibergii ; the distinctly tetragonal appearance of the receptacle in N . tetragona ; and in the longer carpellary appendages, the presence usually of more stamens, and purple-colored stamens and pistils in N . tetragona . Only in living plants is it apparent that leaves of N . leibergii are thicker with impressed veins abaxially compared to the relatively thin leaves with raised veins in N . tetragona . Although distinctions in sepal and petal apices (often acute in N . tetragona and often rounded in N . leibergii ) were the basis for the establishment of Castalia leibergii , the characters are variable in both taxa and thus of limited utility in distinguishing them."

It grows in wet areas such as the edges of lakes, ponds, ditches, and creeks, often forming dense stands; in some areas it is a problematic weed. North American populations may be a mix of native strains, European strains, and agronomic cultivars (Merigliano and Lesica 1998).<br><br>The interpretation adopted here is that of Baldini (1995), who treated Phalaris arundinacea sensu stricto as the most widespread species in a complex of three species. The other two species are P. rotgesii (Husn.) Baldini, a diploid that is restricted to France and Italy, and P. caesia Nees, a hexaploid that grows in southern Europe, western Asia, and eastern to southern Africa. Phalaris rotgesii has glumes 2-3.8 mm long, sterile florets 1-1.5 mm long, bisexual florets 2-3 mm long, and anthers about 2 mm long. The corresponding measurements for P. caesia are 6-7 mm, about 2.5 mm, 4-5 mm, and 3.5-4 mm, respectively. Other taxonomists have included P. rotgesii and P. caesia in P. arundinacea. Only P. arundinacea sensu stricto has been found in North America.<br><br>A sterile form of Phalaris arundinacea with striped leaves–Phalaris arundinacea var. picta L., also referred to as Phalaris arundinacea forma variegata (Parnell) Druce–is known as 'Ribbon Grass' or 'Gardener's Gaiters' and is sometimes grown as an ornamental. Baldini (1995) noted that it sometimes appears to escape, and is never found far from a cultivated stand.<br><br>Phalaris arundinacea hybridizes with other species of Phalaris. One hybrid, P. ×monspeliensis Daveau [= P. arundinacea × P. aquatica] is grown for forage.<br><br>.

Once established, it is difficult to eradicate.<br><br>Phragmites australis (Invasive). The appropriate name for these plants is not clear although they probably originated in Europe. The name Pragmites australis, and hence the name Phragmites australis subsp. australis, is based on plants collected from what is now Sydney, Autralia. Unfortunately, there has been no study of plants from Australia, nor of plants from Europe, so it is not clear what name to use for the European plants. Nevertheless because of the importance from a management point of view of being able to distinguish the invasive strain from the native strains, names have been treated for the strains in North America that are not invasive. For additional information, see the invasive plants network site and their page for distinguishing the invasive strain."

Garman 1957; K.W. Horton 1959; L.Roche 1969; T.M.C. Taylor 1959). This has greatly complicated the taxonomy of P . glauca , a dominant tree of interior forests of Canada and Alaska. Three varieties have been recognized. Picea glauca var. albertiana was described as having unusually prominent leaf bases, cones nearly as broad as long, cone scales acute and broader than long, and an unusually narrow crown. These are common characteristics of hybrids (e.g., R.Daubenmire 1974). Picea glauca var. porsildii was described as differing from the type variety by having smooth bark with resin blisters, short angular cone scales, an unusually broad crown, and pubescent twigs. These characteristics, also largely intermediate between those of P . glauca var. glauca and P . engelmannii , may reflect hybridization where the species overlap. Although the two varieties noted above are reported from well beyond the range of sympatry, the diagnostic characteristics are not well correlated and occur rather sporadically. Also the most distinctive feature of the varieties, the crown shape, is in part responsive to competitive pressures. Because of the problems of hybridization and sporadic occurrence of key characters, P . glauca is treated here in the broad sense."

However, extreme variability in spurs and their development can lead to a single plant "simulating all three varieties" (Sheviak 2002b). There is limited geographic sorting of the three proposed varieties, all of which are found in the same habitats and have broadly overlapping ranges in western North America. "Intermediates and populations with variable spur lengths are abundant" (Sheviak 2002b). Luer (1975) also questioned the taxonomic validity of the varieties, even as he was proposing a new combination for one of them. Wallace (2003) suggested the species is "actively evolving" but failed to find molecular markers or consistent physical features to further resolve the three proposed varieties. We suggest more work is needed before the varieties can be reliably separated morphologically and recognized taxonomically.

These infraspecific taxa seem to reflect differing pollination pressures. The moderate spur length and diurnal fragrance of var. dilatata suggests adaptation to diurnal Lepidoptera; the long spurs and primarily nocturnal fragrance of var. leucostachys indicates specialization for moth pollination, and the short spurs and often broader viscidia of var. albiflora suggest a broader range of pollinators or, in extreme cases, specialization for bee or fly pollination. Alone, these characteristics might support recognition at the specific level, but intermediates and populations with variable spur lengths are abundant. In some plants in western Canada, in particular, spurs that are very short when the flower is young grow to equal the lip as the flower ages, and in some they may eventually greatly exceed the lip, thereby simulating all three varieties. Plants with short spurs, either thick or variably slender, occur occasionally across the range of the species. In the southern Rocky Mountains spur reduction reaches an extreme, yet populations with moderate-length spurs occur there as well. In the broad sense, then, P. dilatata forms a cohesive unit in which spur length varies greatly, apparently in response to differing pollination pressures. The northwest is the center of variability of the species, and as it ranges eastward through the boreal forest, and southward down the Rockies and the more western ranges, it appears to have specialized for different pollinators. The recognized varieties of P. dilatata are evidentally merely endpoints in a very complex variation pattern. They have some utility for discussion purposes, but they are very simplistic representations of the underlying situation. Variety leucostachys and, to a lesser extent, var. dilatata appear to be real entities that have emerged from a background of variability that continues to produce similar plants. This variability is here treated within var. albiflora.<br><br>Platanthera dilatata hybridizes with P. huronensis and P. purpurascens, and perhaps also does so with other related species; see the note under 10.

The relationship of some of these plants to P. hyperborea needs study. Platanthera huronensis is typically intensely fragrant with the sweet, pungent scent of some related species. Platanthera huronensis is known to hybridize with P. dilatata; it may hybridize with other species as well.

H. Wagner 1979). Cytological analysis corroborates this (A. D. Callan 1972; W. H.

Hybrids with both P . dudleyi and P . munitum are found frequently, because these three species are often sympatric (W. H. Wagner 1973). The hybrid with P . dudleyi (a triploid) will key to that species. The hybrid with P . munitum resembles a less-incised form of P . californicum with aborted sporangia. Polystichum californicum × imbricans has been found only once, in Oregon (A. D. Callan 1972). Another hybrid that will key here, based on its overall appearance, is P . munitum × scopulinum .

If one examines only the types of those two taxa and that of P. fremontii, it seems that perhaps two or three taxa might be recognized. Upon careful study of extensive material, one realizes that only one taxon, instead of three or more, is represented. The alleged differences between P. fremontii and P. williamsiae in characters other than fruit morphology do not hold. As for fruit size, it was said to be 2-4 × 2-2.5 mm in P. williamsiae and (4-)6-13(-20) × 1-2 mm in P. fremontii. Fruit lengths in material annotated by Rollins as P. fremontii are 2-7 mm in Tiehm 8108 and 3.5-11 mm in Ertter 5726, both at GH. Furthermore, the compactness of the infructescence can be equally variable, and in the holotype of var. confertum there are 12-15 pedicels along 1 cm in the middle of the rachis, whereas in Ertter 5726 (GH) there are 6-12. On one sheet, Schoolcraft 1287 (GH), compact and lax racemes and relatively short (3 mm) and longer (7 mm) fruits are represented. The variation in fruit length and width depends largely upon the number of ovules maturing into seeds, and in plants with very short fruits, including the type collection of P. williamsiae, none of the ovules matured into seeds, whereas in those with longest and narrowest fruits almost all ovules matured into seeds. Regardless of how long the fruit is or how many ovules mature into seeds, the ovule number is fairly constant throughout the range of the species.

Haufler, M. D. Windham, and E. W. Rabe, unpublished). Variations in spore surface morphology and banding patterns observed in isozyme studies indicate that P . hesperium may have originated more than once from different individuals of the same species. Some collections of P . hesperium can be mistaken for P . glycyrrhiza , but the latter species is easily distinguished by its pubescent rachises, linear blade scales, and smaller spores (less than 58 Âµm). Although P . amorphum has sporangiasters and P . hesperium lacks them, misshapen sporangia in P . hesperium can mimic these distinctive soral structures. Therefore, it is often necessary to use a combination of soral, stem scale, and blade scale features (discussed in the key) to separate P . hesperium from P . amorphum . Hybridization occurs between P . hesperium and each of its progenitor diploids to form triploid individuals with misshapen spores (F. A. Lang 1971).

Daubenmire also found that awn length varies continuously within plants grown from seed. He concluded that the ability to produce rhizomes and unawned plants is heritable, that the two characters are not linked, and that the form which becomes dominant at a local site is determined by environmental conditions.<br><br>The unawned phase tends to be more restricted in its distribution than the awned phase, being dominant in the native grasslands of southern British Columbia, eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northern and eastern Oregon; the awned phase is found throughout the range of the species. Many populations include awned and unawned plants, as well as some that have poorly developed awns on some lemmas. Awned autotetraploid populations grow in mesic grassland and woodland communities of the hills and mountains of southern British Columbia and eastern Washington.<br><br>Based on informal observations, plant breeders working with Pseudoroegneria spicata consider that awn presence is determined by a single major gene, and modified by some minor genes. The unawned condition is apparently dominant, as seed from crosses of heterozygotic, diploid, unawned parents gives rise to around 50% awned offspring.<br><br>The above observations make it clear that the awned and unawned phases of Pseudoroegneria spicata are of little taxonomic significance, despite their evident morphological difference. If it is considered necessary to distinguish between them, the awned phase can be called Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve forma spicata and the unawned phase P. spicata forma inermis (Scribn. & J.G. Sm.) Barkworth.<br><br>Plants with densely pubescent leaves are known from the east slope of the Cascade Mountains in Washington. Plants with nearly as densely pubescent leaves are found elsewhere in southern Washington and northeastern Oregon. Such pubescent plants may be called Pseudoroegneria spicata forma pubescens (Elmer) Barkworth.<br><br>Pseudoroegneria spicata used to be confused with Elymus wawawaiensis, from which it differs in its more widely spaced spikelets and wider, less stiff glumes. The two species are geographically sympatric, but P. spicata grows in medium- to fine-textured loess soils, and E. wawawaiensis in shallow, rocky soils. Pseudoroegneria spicata may also be confused with Elymus arizonicus, particularly with immature specimens of that species or specimens mounted so that they appear to have erect, rather than drooping, spikes. It differs in having shorter, truncate ligules and generally thicker culms than E. arizonicus, and in having a distribution that extends much further north.<br><br>Pseudoroegneria spicata has been suggested as one of the parents in numerous natural hybrids with species of Elymus in the Flora region. These hybrids are usually mostly sterile, but development of even a few viable seeds permits introgression to occur, as well as the formation of distinctive populations. It is often difficult to detect such hybrids, particularly if they involve the unawned form of Pseudoroegneria. The named hybrids are treated under ×Pseudelymus (p. ??). Others are discussed under the Elymus parent."

Some authors have included them all in R. rosea [or Sedum rosea (Linnaeus) Scopoli], often with subspecies or varieties; N. L. Britton and J. N. Rose (1905) earlier divided them into two to several species.<br><br>For this complex C. H. Uhl (1952) cited six published chromosome counts from Greenland through Eurasia to Japan, all n = 11 or 2n = 22; he found the same numbers in seven collections from northeastern North America (all these Rhodiola rosea proper). From Eurasia, according to R. L. Taylor and G. A. Mulligan (1968), races with 2n = 16 and 33 also are known. On the other hand, for endemics in Minnesota and New York and for five plants from New Mexico and California, Uhl found n = 18 or 2n = 36, and Taylor and Mulligan likewise found 2n = 36 in plants of Moresby Island, British Columbia. With the support of five more counts, but with none for the large area of Oregon and Wyoming to the Bering Sea, R. T. Clausen (1975) separated the 36-chromosome plants as Sedum integrifolium. More counts of 2n = 36 have since appeared, including one from Sutwick Island, off the Alaska Peninsula (Á. Löve 1979).<br><br>In middle North America, Rhodiola integrifolia and R. rosea are geographically distinct. The local endemic subsp. leedyi of the former grows in Minnesota, midway between the western subspecies of R. integrifolia and the eastern R. rosea, and grows in New York state within 100 km of R. rosea. Otherwise, the ranges of the two species are over 2000 km apart in the south and nearly 3000 km in the north. Rhodiola integrifolia also is the prevailing plant in eastern Asia, where it has been named Sedum atropurpureum N. S. Turczaninow (E. Hultén 1941-1950, vol. 5), and R. rosea seems to extend (although not verified by chromosome counts) from eastern Asia to far-western Alaska, on the coast of the Bering Sea.<br><br>Although saying that Sedum integrifolium differs from S. rosea in many ways besides the chromosome number, R. T. Clausen (1975) found few absolute distinctions. His best key characters were those used here, petal width of staminate flowers, largely supported by flower color. Although questions remain unanswered, it seems best for now to follow Clausen in keeping the two species for North America.<br><br>Over its broad range, Rhodiola integrifolia is quite variable (e.g., see E. Hultén 1941-1950, vol. 5). R. T. Clausen (1975) noted that in some populations pistillate plants outnumber staminate; in others staminate may be six times as many as pistillate. He distinguished two outlying endemics as subspp. leedyi and neomexicana, also kept as subspecies here. He also proposed subsp. procer[a] for tall robust plants of Colorado, New Mexico, and (less typical) California, all within the range of subsp. integrifolia and all with the same chromosome number. Some of his plants look remarkably different from the usual dwarf forms of subsp. integrifolia that grow at the same high elevations. He did not include in subsp. procera (and apparently did not see alive) the tall plants often found inland in Alaska and northwestern Canada, which would be Sedum frigidum Rydberg according to Hultén. Thus the racial situation is much more complex than the naming of only two peripheral subspecies might suggest."

Extremes are evidently distinct (e.g., R. arcticus and R. tomentellus). The taxonomy and distribution of members of this aggregate are still insufficiently known. Some authors prefer to treat all or most of these taxa as subspecies or varieties of R. aquaticus in the broad sense.

The morphotype of R. fenestratus occurs mostly along the Pacific coast from central western California to Alaska. Plants with large fruiting inner tepals [known as R. fenestratus var. labradoricus Rechinger f. or R. occidentalis var. labradoricus (Rechinger f.)

It and R. fueginus differ from Eurasian R. maritimus in many respects and are as distinct as many widely recognized Eurasian taxa of this aggregate (e.g., R. palustris, R. rossicus Murbeck, R. ucranicus Fischer ex Sprengel, R. marschallianus Reichenbach, R. amurensis Fr. Schmidt ex Maximowicz, R. evenkiensis Elisarjeva). When submerging R. persicarioides as a variety of R. maritimus, Mitchell noted: "Taxonomic treatment of the group from a Eurasian point of view would undoubtedly shed light on the minor problems which we face in North and South America." However, from a Eurasian point of view (see e.g., K. H. Rechinger 1937, 1949; J. E. Lousley and D. H. Kent 1981; N. N. Tzvelev 1989b), all North American native taxa of subsect. Maritimi  are evidently specifically different from any native Eurasian ones (with the only possible exception of Pacific plants, which are discussed below).<br><br>Plants similar to Rumex persicarioides, but with bigger tubercles and occuring along the Pacific coast from northern California to British Columbia, are, in my opinion, closer to R. fueginus in their habit and vegetative characters. K. H. Rechinger (1937) provisionally determined such specimens as R. persicarioides. J. E. Dawson (1979) noted that the Pacific plants differ from Atlantic ones in having bigger tubercles (more than 1.9 × 0.7-1 mm in western plants; less than 1.9 × 0.7 mm in eastern R. persicarioides in the narrow sense), and described these large-tubercled plants as a distinct variety, "R. maritimus var. pacificus", unfortunately, an invalid name. However, that taxon seems to be extremely closely related to or possibly conspecific with the northeastern Asian species, R. ochotskius Rechinger f., which is known in eastern Asia from northern Japan to the Okhotsk Sea region of Russian Far East (especially Sakhalin and Kuril islands). The latter species also has large (to 2-2.5 mm) botuliform tubercles with obtuse apices. In the original description Rechinger stated: ""¦foliorum forma R. maritimo simillimus"¦," but N. N. Tzvelev (1989b) in his recent treatment of the genus in the Russian Far East noted that most of the specimens of R. ochotskius seen by him had leaf blades rotundate-truncate or broadly cuneate at the base. The R. persicarioides-like plants from the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada (as well as their most probable allies from eastern Asia) need additional study. At present I prefer to place them provisionally into R. persicarioides, following Rechinger's treatment."

Smith (1968) showed that both diploids and tetraploids (and even exceptional spontaneous triploids and individuals with higher polyploid chromosome numbers) occur in many other localities within the range of the species; the differences in chromosome number are not strictly correlated with distribution or morphology. Narrow-leaved ecotypes of R. paucifolius reported by Smith sometimes resemble other narrow-leaved taxa of subg. Acetosella, especially R. beringensis. Rumex paucifolius and R. beringensis may be regarded as morphologically and karyologically transitional between subg. Acetosella and subg. Acetosa. Rumex paucifolius was placed in the monotypic subsect. Paucifoliae Á. Löve & N. Sarkar. Later, Löve transferred it to the segregate genus Acetosella, based mostly on the chromosome number of the species, but morphology suggests it is a member of subg. Acetosa. Probably the best solution of this problem was proposed by Smith, who noted that "the composite range of vegetative, reproductive, and karyotypic characteristics of the forty-odd species now included in the diversified subgenus Acetosa would be only slightly extended by the addition of the five species now classified as Acetosella" (p. 683)."

However, one specimen from Okanogan County annotated as S. farriae by George Argus in 2005.  <br><br>FNA7: "Salix farriae is a cordilleran species ranging from Wyoming to central British Columbia with disjunct occurrences in northwestern British Columbia, western Northwest Territories, and southern Yukon. It is related to S. hastata, an amphiberingian species ranging from Scandinavia to southwestern Yukon and northwestern Northwest Territories. There may be reasons for treating these slightly different plants as S. hastata var. farriae, but R. D. Dorn (1975) maintained them as a species based on flavonoid differences. In a phenetic study (G. W. Argus 2007), the two taxa had dissimilarity values at the same level as other closely related species. They are treated here as species, primarily because their ranges are disjunct. They can be separated as follows:<br><br>Salix farriae is distinguished from S. hastata by having largest medial blades narrowly elliptic to elliptic, pistillate nectaries oblong or ovate, stipules on early leaves absent or rudimentary (sometimes foliaceous), branches strongly to weakly glaucous or not, floral bract apices rounded, and plants of the cordillera in Alberta and British Columbia, in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming; S. hastata has largest medial blades narrowly elliptic to broadly elliptic or broadly obovate, pistillate nectaries square, stipules on early leaves foliaceous (sometimes rudimentary), branches not glaucous, floral bract apices acute or rounded, and plants of Alaska, Northwest Territories, and Yukon.<br><br>Salix farriae and S. barclayi are sympatric in western Canada and the Pacific Northwest, where they are difficult to separate. Salix farriae can often be recognized by its largest medial leaves with at least some minute, ferruginous hairs on the adaxial midrib or blade surfaces; ferruginous hairs do not occur in S. barclayi. Its leaf margins also tend to be more nearly entire, but relatively short teeth are not infrequent. Such plants are sometimes interpreted as intergrades between S. farriae and S. barclayi (R. D. Dorn 1975). The variable leaf toothing also occurs in S. hastata and may not be a reliable indicator of intergradation. Salix farriae also differs from S. barclayi in usually having shorter anthers, 0.3-0.6 mm versus 0.6-1 mm in S. barclayi. See 61. S. barclayi."

It is highly variable and three very similar taxa have been named: S. amplifolia, S. hookeriana (including vars. tomentosa and laurifolia), and S. piperi. Although extremes of these taxa sometimes are recognizable, the intergradation displayed is so great that even attempts to recognize them as varieties are thwarted. The amplifolia  variant in Alaska is characterized by having only white leaf hairs, hairy ovaries, no stipules, and catkins often borne on distinct flowering branchlets, but variation can occur within the same population, and typical S. hookeriana on Vancouver Island sometimes displays the same characteristics. The piperi variant, an inland population in western Oregon and Washington, is usually recognized by local botanists as different from coastal populations. It is characterized by leaves and branchlets soon becoming glabrate and stipules prominent. These characteristics, however, sometimes appear in northern California coastal populations, and some inland populations in Oregon include very hairy individuals that are indistinguishable from coastal variants of S. hookeriana. In general, very hairy populations of S. hookeriana are probably an adaptation to marine coastal environments, but some variation may be due to hybridization and introgression with S. scouleriana. Inland populations suggest the influence of S. lasiolepis. Two hexaploid chromosome numbers reported for S. hookeriana from Vancouver Island (R. L. Taylor and S. Taylor 1977) and Queen Charlotte Islands (R. L. Taylor and G. A. Mulligan 1968), British Columbia, indicate that hybridization has played a role in the evolution of this complex. It is possible that each variant of S. hookeriana has had a different, possibly even recurrent, polyploid origin. Further cytological and genetic study is indicated.<br><br>The following comparisons may help to distinguish Salix hookeriana, S. lasiolepis, and S. scouleriana.<br><br>Vegetative specimens of Salix hookeriana can be distinguished from S. lasiolepis by having floral buds ellipsoid, beaks distinctly long-tapered, densely long-hairy (villous), red-brown, blades usually pilose, villous, or woolly on abaxial surfaces, usually 18-63 mm wide, and 1.5-4.2 times as long as wide; S. lasiolepis has floral buds ovoid, beaks inconspicuous and blunt, sparsely to moderately densely short-hairy (velvety), yellowish to red-brown, blades usually tomentose on abaxial surfaces, usually 6-32 mm wide, and 3.2-9.6 times as long as wide.<br><br>Salix hookeriana is distinguished from S. scouleriana by having branchlets with spreading hairs (woolly or tomentose to glabrate), petioles usually pilose to tomentose, blades typically narrowly elliptic but variable, stigmas 0.3-0.74, short in relation to styles (0.6-2.3 mm), and pistillate nectaries 0.5-1.4 mm, shorter or longer than stipes; S. scouleriana has branchlets usually with short, erect hairs (velutinous), sometimes spreading (villous or tomentose), petioles velvety or villous adaxially, blades typically oblanceolate but variable, stigmas 0.4-1.04 mm, long in relation to styles (0.2-0.6 mm), and pistillate nectaries 0.2-0.8 mm, shorter than stipes.<br><br>Hybrids:<br><br>Salix hookeriana forms natural hybrids with S. barclayi and S. scouleriana. Variation in some S. hookeriana populations suggests hybridization with S. lasiolepis but no positive identifications have been made. R. D. Dorn (2000) doubted that hybridization in California between these species with different chromosome numbers was possible, but species with different chromosome numbers do hybridize [for example, S. athabascensis (4x) × S. pedicellaris (2x)]; synthetic hybridization studies are indicated.<br><br>Salix hookeriana × S. scouleriana: Plants from southern British Columbia with leaves similar to S. hookeriana but with prominent stipules, catkins both erect and recurving, and relatively long stigmas were thought by J. K. Henry (1915) to be this hybrid."

Although it is possible to identify dry specimens to some extent, by comparison, it is impossible to obtain from dried specimens data that can be used in a taxonomic revision. Characters that may be taxonomically useful are lost on drying, especially flower and inflorescence characters and those derived from the fleshy vegetative segments. Habit appears to be useful, but few specimen labels note the habit of the living plant, and the parts collected rarely allow for a reliable determination of habit. Some species, such as S. perennis are prostrate, with the woody stems readily rooting in the substrate. Others such as S. pacifica are procumbent to erect shrubs in which the woody stems usually do not root. This apparently obvious habit difference is sometimes confounded by external factors, erect species becoming procumbent due to water movement, trampling, or burial by silt or sand deposits. Conversely, prostrate rooting species can be disturbed by erosion and appear to be procumbent plants of a nonrooting species.<br><br>One of the most useful characters, the indumentum on the testa of the seeds, is rarely present in dried specimens because of the lateness of the plants' flowering season. Plants collected in August and September rarely have even immature seeds present, so most herbarium specimens do not display this character.<br><br>The consequence of these problems is that most accounts of Sarcocornia in North America recognize only one species, frequently using the name Salicornia virginica Linnaeus for the collective entity.

One of the most common of western North American shrubs in alkaline habitats, S. vermiculatus grows among other shrubs or in pure stands, often to great extent, especially in the Great Basin. It is frequently codominant with Allenrolfea in areas that support little else. Other, less alkali-tolerant associates may include species of Artemisia (even A. tridentata), Atriplex, Chrysothamnus, Grayia, Krascheninnikovia, Larrea, and Suaeda. Sarcobatus vermiculatus ranks among the important western browse plants, but it has a dark side. Range animals and wildlife feed on it; the plant's saline taste perhaps enhances its palatability. Under certain conditions, poisoning of animals, especially sheep, may result from the plant's content of sodium and potassium oxalates (10-22% of plant dry weight). Death may occur when sheep eat large amounts of S. vermiculatus---and little or nothing else---in a short time. A notable mass poisoning of sheep occurred in 1920 when 1700 ewes in transit were unloaded and allowed to browse in a pure stand of S. vermiculatus. The next morning 1000 were dead (J. M. Kingsbury 1964). Sarcobatus vermiculatus is allegedly a phreatophyte; its taproots are said to be able to penetrate as much as 57 feet below the surface. Large communities of greasewood coincide with areas where the water table is less than 15 feet below the surface, although the plant can survive with water table depth to 25 feet (H. N.

A. Mulligan and L. G. Bailey 1975; I. A. Al-Shehbaz 1985; R. C. Rollins and Al-Shehbaz 1986). It is generally considered a native of Eurasia and is thought to have been introduced into the New World by European settlers about 400 years ago. Recent archaeological and ethnobotanical studies (H. A. Jacobson et al. 1988) indicate that it (as Brassica kaber) grew in the northeastern United States as early as 8000 years ago and suggest that it originally had a semi-circumboreal distribution."

Morton in his treatment of Silene for Flora of North America. Closely related to Silene oregana and S. sargentii. Not in H&C - see JPM for a key to species.<br><br>FNA5: "Silene bernardina is the earliest valid name for this species. Watson had previously (1875) named it S. montana, and that name was taken up by C. L. Hitchcock and B. Maguire (1947), who cited S. bernardina as a subspecies of S. montana. Unfortunately, the epithet montana is pre-occupied in Silene by S. montana Arrondeau (1863), an unrelated European species. The situation was further complicated by Watson in 1877, when he used the name Lychnis montana for another unrelated species now transferred to Silene and called S. hitchguirei.<br><br>Silene bernardina varies in leaf width, pubescence, and flower color. The broader-leaved and more sparsely pubescent forms have been referred to subsp. bernardina, and the more-common, narrower-leaved, more-densely pubescent, and viscid forms have been referred to subsp. maguirei.<br><br>Some forms of Silene bernardina can be difficult to distinguish from S. verecunda, S. sargentii, and S. oregana. Silene verecunda differs in its smaller, clavate calyx and in its petals being only shortly two-lobed. Silene sargentii is a small, densely cespitose, high-alpine species with very narrow, linear leaves (1-2 mm wide), shortly two-lobed petals, and seeds with much larger papillae around the margins. In S. oregana the petals are larger (two times the calyx) and deeply divided into many very narrow segments; the claw and the filaments are glabrous; the leaves, particularly the basal ones, are broader; and the inflorescences are narrower, with the more numerous flowers arranged on short, ascending branches; also, the calyx lobes are ovate and obtuse instead of lanceolate and acute."

S. asplenifolia Greene found at Seattle in hay meadows is apparently the same and perhaps was introduced with grass seed."<br> <br><br>The lack of specimens for this species from WA over the last 100 years strongly suggests that it is likely not part of the contemporary flora.  The draft treatment for this species in the Flora of North America also does not consider it present in WA.

The type specimen was collected in 1820 by Edwin James along the Canadian River in the Texas panhandle. J. Torrey (1827) tentatively identified it as "Chenopodium maritimum L. ?". Rafinesque named it Chenopodium nigrum, long before Torrey's publication of the name Chenopodina moquinii in 1856. C. O. Hopkins and W. H. Blackwell (1977) suggested that the name Chenopodium nigrum was both a nomen nudum and a superfluous name. But the publication of that name included a clear reference to Torrey's 1832 publication, which means that the name was not a nomen nudum, and the specimen belonged to a new species, which means that the name was not superfluous. "Suaeda fruticosa" with the incorrect author combination (Linnaeus) Forsskål has been misapplied to this species (H. J. Schenk and W. R. Ferren Jr. 2001).<br><br>Suaeda nigra exhibits much phenotypic plasticity, as well as genetic variability, and is wide ranging. This combination has resulted in the naming of many variants that often reflect a response to localized or regional habitat conditions such as degree of wetness, salinity, or freezing temperatures (C. O. Hopkins and W. H. Blackwell 1977). In California and adjacent states, for example, glabrous plants (S. torreyana var. torreyana) and pubescent plants (S. torreyana var. ramosissima) occur throughout the distribution of the species. In California it is coastal but not estuarine in the San Francisco Bay area and in Orange and San Diego counties. Plants of northern latitudes or higher elevations that are prone to freezing tend to have annual stems from a woody base. Plants that occur in more southern or milder conditions are usually shrubs with perennial stems.

Notable among these are var. elegans, a form with incised or perforate fruit wings, and var. eradiatus, a form with rayless, entire wings. Some of these may be the result of hybridization with other taxa. For instance, var. elegans  has large fruits and occurs in the vicinity of T. radians, the largest-fruited member of the genus. Furthermore, fruits of var. elegans  often have pointed hairs like those usually found on fruits of T. radians; such hairs are not found on fruits of any other members of the genus.

It has been widely introduced in western North America for erosion control, revegetation, forage, and hay. One of its advantages for erosion control and revegetation is that it establishes rapidly in many different habitats. In its native range, it grows in dry areas with sandy or stony soils. In Europe, it forms sterile hybrids with Elymus repens; no such hybrids are known from North America.<br><br>Several subspecies have been recognized within Thinopyrum intermedium, usually based on differences in vestiture of the glumes and lemmas, presence or absence of lemma awns, and color of the plants. Assadi (1994) commented that there was little correlation between the different character states. He grew seeds from several wild plants and, even when most of the offspring resembled the parent plant, there was often segregation of other variants. Crossing experiments showed that hybrids between the morphological variants were fertile and usually had regular meiosis. He noted, however, that the plants with glabrous spikelets tended to grow in mesophytic habitats, those with hairy glumes and lemmas on dry slopes, and those with ciliate glumes and lemmas at the edges of fields and in wet places. This difference in habitat preference was reiterated by Ogle (2001). Because of this ecological distinction, they are formally recognized here as subspecies. Plants with hairs only on the outer edges of their lemmas are included under T. intemedium subsp. intermedium. They may be derived from crosses between the hairy and glabrous plants, a possibility that has not been experimentally evaluated. There seems to be little correlation between spikelet vestiture and that of the leaves and stems.<br><br> There is no known difference in geographic distribution between subsp. intermedium and subsp. barbulatum. Ogle (2001) states that T. intermedium subsp. intermedium is adapted to areas with 12-13 inches of rainfall per year."

Therefore, the appropriate name under Tripleuro-spermum is T. inodorum. She also considered its type to belong in T. maritimum and formally recognized it there as subsp. inodorum, on the basis of hybridization with other T. maritimum subspecies (A. Vaarama 1953); on the same basis, however, Hämet-Ahti maintained the species distinction between T. inodorum and T. maritimum, while making T. phaeocephalum  a subspecies of the latter. Q. O. N. Kay (1994), in a more extensive review of the literature and of hybridization data, also maintained T. inodorum and T. maritimum as distinct species, a conclusion followed here.

Hotchkiss and H. L. Dozier (1949), Typha domingensis was generally included within T. angustifolia in North America. Because of many misidentified specimens, range expansion in recent years, and undercollecting, the distribution on the margins of the main range is somewhat uncertain. Many literature reports are based on misidentified specimens. Some workers suggested T. angustifolia was early introduced from Europe into Atlantic Coastal North America and migrated westward (R. L. Stuckey and D. P. Salamon 1987). In recent decades it has expanded its range in many regions and become much more abundant, especially in roadside ditches and other highly disturbed habitats. For example, although it was known only from one Wisconsin station in 1929 (N. C. Fassett 1930) and was very local in Iowa in 1939 (A. Hayden 1939), it is now common and widespread in both states. As it often out-competes many native marsh species to produce very dense, pure stands, and hybridizes with T. latifolia to form the probably even more competitive T. &#61620;glauca, T. angustifolia and T. &#61620;glauca should perhaps be classified as noxious weeds in parts of North America.

It extends southward to North Carolina in the Atlantic and Baja California in the Pacific. At the southern limits of its range, active growth mostly is in the cooler months of autumn and spring, with flowering and fruiting mostly in the spring and the plants dying in the hotter summer months, the vegetation becoming dislodged from the substrate and floating to the water surface. The fruits apparently remain in the floating vegetation for a period of time, eventually falling from the shoots to the substrate. Movement in dislodged vegetative material is the only adaptation the fruits have for dispersal (C. den Hartog 1970).<br><br>The species is found mostly in the sublittoral region, only rarely being exposed at low tide. It occurs in more or less sheltered areas on soft mud or firm sand. Plants of sandy substrates had narrower leaves than plants growing on muddy substrates (C. H. Ostenfeld 1905). Fruits fall from the floating vegetation to the substrate and settle on the substrate ripple marks, which run more or less perpendicular to the direction of current. Seedling establishment is parallel with the ripple marks, forming vegetated ridges separated by depressions, which gradually fill with sediments, and the plants then grow laterally into them, forming a meadow (C. den Hartog 1970). The vegetation lowers the velocity of current flow, causing some suspended particles to settle out and accumulate around the base of the plants, slowly building the substrate. As more particles accumulate, the substrate gets deeper over the rhizomes, since the rhizomes grow horizontally, not vertically. Eventually, the rhizomes are too deep, and the plants begin to die back, a phenomenon followed by erosion."
