Goal 1: write a parser for the USDA PLANTS list
Needs to keep genus, species, "var"/variation names, "ssp"/subspecies names, "x" or hybrid names
Needs to remove author names and/or initials, and author-related lowercase phrases "ex", "bis", etc.

Goal 2: update clean_nursery_catalog.py to play nice with the USDA PLANTS list
compare_and_clean should be able to work the same way
need to make a function to extract scientific name from the correct column!
OK, clean_nursery_catalog.py now works with a QUOTE delimited file, if you tell it the column name
Not generalized to other files (IE CSV, TSV) yet.

Goal 3: Make new clean nursery catalogs using USDA PLANTS list
Done!

Goal 4: Run native-plant-availability using new clean nursery catalogs.
Done!

Goal 5: Add a discard bin - a file which contains the list of plants available at nurseries, but NOT on the WA native species list (the WA Flora Checklist from DNR NHP)
Done!

Goal 6: Cross-reference the output plant list by nursery with the NHP spreadsheet
Need to match the Sci Names in output list to Sci Names in NHP list, and get all the columns from both into a new file
Done!
(This script is also highly generalizable)

Goal 7: Add more nursery catalogs to the dataset!
	I now have a total of 23 nursery catalogs represented in the dataset - they are only the ones with accessible plant lists online.

Initial findings with 23 nurseries:

Total number of native species and infraspecies:

Wrote the clean_nursery_catalog.py script, which accepts a reference list of plants and a file (like a text document or CSV) and pulls out all the instances of the reference list items. Then it outputs it as a new file.
In this case, I input a list of scientific names of WA plants and the text of a nursery catalog, and get a cleaned-up list of all the scientific names of WA plants which appear in the catalog.
There are a few edge cases to deal with here:
* Some species have changed genus and/or species names - need to add outdated names to reference list?
* Genus names are listed in addition to Genus + species names. Do I want to include those? -- YES, but check for duplicates before adding to final list.
* What if there's a typo in the catalog? IDK man

And a few improvements to make:
* Would like to actually get ALL the species names, not just the WA native plants. Then later, I can see which plant species are in the catalog but AREN'T on the WA native plants list.
* Will need to update script to play nice with the USDA PLANTS Database

Wrote the native-plant-availability.py script, which accepts the cleaned nursery catalog and a reference list of plants (in this case, WA native plants), and creates a new CSV which lists ALL the reference plants and which nurseries they can be found at. 

Improvements to make:
* Output a "discard bin" of plants which appeared in the nursery list but did NOT appear in the reference list.
* Cross-reference to the NHP spreadsheet which includes information about growth form. Would like to find a dataset which includes a full plant list and its ecoregions for WA.

Questions to answer:
* What types/growth forms of species are being included/excluded from nursery lists?
* What genera and/or families are being included/excluded?
* What regions of the state are being included/excluded?

In other words, how do we summarize what plants ARE represented, and what plants are NOT?
